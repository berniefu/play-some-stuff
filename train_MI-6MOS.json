She first noted drainage from her left great toe five days prior to admission. This was accompanied by toe swelling, fevers to 100.5 and chills, but she denies pain in her L great toe. Almost simultaneous with the drainage from her L great toe, she also noted increasing pain from the lateral aspect of the plantar surface of her left forefoot, especially when walking. She denies any trauma to her left foot. She reports that the ulcer on her right lateral foot is stable, and she has been dressing it with Panafil ointment as prescribed by Dr. Salgado. She denies any rest pain, and reports that her prior claudication is almost fully resolved following her R SFA angioplasty last year. She presented today to Dr. Salgado&#8217;s clinic for routine follow-up, when wet gangrene of her L great toe was detected on clinical exam.

He underwent angioplasty of the circumflex vessels and then angioplasty and stenting of the first diagonal branch to the LAD. The latter one was done in the second setting and part of the study where the the stent versus a plain stent. This was done by Dr. Winn, and Dr. Cook. Since then he has been tired, otherwise felt well. He had reasonable lipids but low HDL syndrome. His blood sugars have been controlled recently with A1C's in the 6 range. He is overweight and does not do any regular exercise program. He is on for arthritis.\nHis current medications consist of aspirin 325 mg per day, Plavix 75 mg per day, Glucatrol 10 mg twice daily and Glucophage 500 mg twice daily, Atenolol 25 mg daily, Nexium 20 mg per day, Flomax .4 and Zestril.

He has been very compliant with his medication regimen which consists of metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and NPH insulin subQ q.AM. He has had 2 episodes of sweating, but he did not check his blood sugar at the time. He has not had any frank palpitations or lightheadedness. He did have 1 episode where he had the sensation of several extra heart beats. This was not accompanied by other symptoms including no chest pain. He has never had a fingerstick blood glucose below the mid 150's. I am looking through his log and see that his AM prebreakfast glucoses have been between 178-306 and before dinner they have been between 157-296. He has already met several times with Makenzie Kim for diabetes education and for tailoring of his therapy and has met with a nutritionist to review the concepts of a diabetic diet. On physical exam, he is in no distress, his weight is 231, his blood pressure is 132\/78 in the right arm sitting. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: He still has high sugars. I will increase his insulin regimen. He is amenable to adding a second injection and so his new regimen will be NPH insulin 15 units before breakfast and 15 units before bedtime. And he continues to take metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and I have given him a prescription for this, #90, refills 3, as well as syringes and needles, #60, refills 3. He is to follow up with me in several months and sooner if he has new problems or concerns. I have advised him about increasing his level of activity and about maintaining his diet and I have also asked him to contact me if he should have any symptoms of hypoglycemia and to obtain his fingerstick glucose reading at that time as well.

In brief the patient is a 62 yo man with mental retardation, HTN, hyperlipidemia, head trauma with SDH with evacuation, DM who presents with gait instability and difficulty with speaking and swallowing. Per guardian the patient was in his USOH until 9\/24\/75 evening at approximately 8:30pm he was found to have mumbled speech and having difficulty with ambulation with leaning to the left. On 9\/25\/75 in the morning he had a fall when getting out of bed and struck his head, and brought to the ED. No prior history of stroke or TIA.\n\nMEDS: ASA, Metformin, Glyberide, Tegretol, Fosinoperil, Lipitor, HCTZ\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nVITALS: BP 130\/85\nMS: AA&Ox3, speech fluent with slurring (unclear baseline), repeats and names well. Comprehends simple commands. Names president\nCN: PERRL, VF full with BTT. EOMI but with nystagmus in all directions of gaze, even primary gaze. Facial sensation intact. Face asymmetric. Tongue, palate symmetric. SCM and traps 5\/5.\nMotor: UMN pattern weakness in RUE (4-\/5), most notable in hands. Mild proximal RLE weak (4+\/5).\nCoord: Impaired FTN in LUE, intact in RUE.\nRefl: Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ at biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patella, and ankles. Plantar response is flexor on right and extensor on left.\nSens: Decreased PP but NOT LT in LUE and LLE\n\nImaging:\nMRI Brain (9\/25\/75) DWI bright ADC dark right lateral medullary pyramid with associated increased T2 signal.\nMRA Head\/Neck (9\/25\/75) Narrowing of basilar artery with flow signal throughout and no thrombosis\nCTA Head\/Neck (9\/25\/75) Diffuse atherosclerotic disease, occluded R-ICA with good collateralization of right hemisphere, severe irregular narrowing through out bilateral vertebral arteries and basilar arteries.\n\nIMPRESSION: The patient has numerous risk factors for stroke with HTN, DM2, and HLP. His exam is consistent with lateral medullary pyramid lesion with involvement of spinalcortical tract prior to decussation explaining ipsilateral weakness and also involvement of the spinalthalamic tract explaining contralateral deficit in pain sensation. His vessel imaging is notable and concerning for diffuse atherosclerotic disease, specifically in posterior circulation in distribution of acute stroke. The patient was reportedly taking aspirin, though reports are mixed and this needs clarification. Vessel imaging did not implicate that the patient suffered from acute vertebro-basilar thrombo-embolism, but that his posterior circulation disease is a chronic issue and the stroke was more likely due to distal vessel thrombosis. Anticoagulation can be considered in acute setting of small sized posterior circulation stroke with vertebro-basilar disease, but in this case by the time the patient became known to neurology service and by the time it was known he had a stroke it was some 24hrs after initial symptoms, and in this interval he did not show any signs or symptoms of stroke progression making unstable plaque unlikely. Given the findings of the WASID study that anticoagulation did not significantly improve recurrent stroke prevention benefits over aspirin for symptomatic vertebro-basilar disease (because warfarin benefits were offset by higher hemorrhage rates), the decision to place this patient on aspirin is supported. The long term management of this patient requires aggressive control of atherosclerotic risk factors such as HTN, DM2, and HLP. The patient is significantly at risk of major ischemic stroke due to occluded right carotid artery and diffuse posterior circulation disease, and it is conceivable that if he continues to have persistent symptoms in the future that a revascularization procedure may be necessary.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Aspirin 325 mg po qd\n2. Continue Lipitor\n3. HTN management as an outpatient, autoregulate x 24hrs for SBP<180 mmHg\n4. DM2 management\n5. Check lipids, homocysteine, lipoprotein a, hba1c\n6. Check TCDs to obtain baseline data\n7. Consider TTE\/Holter as outpatient as unlikely this was a cardioembolic event\n\nFreddie V.

The paramedics and police were called the scene. The police were able to force open the door of the home. The patient was found unconscious on the floor, having a generalized tonic clonic seizure. The patient was intubated and given 4 mg of Ativan prior to arrival in the Emergency Department with the paramedics. On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be comatose, intubated, and clearly in acute distress. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus. She has had a seizure in the past, apparently secondary to hypoglycemia. She also has a history of high blood pressure. She is on diltiazem, lisinopril, and medications for hypercholesterolemia. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her temperature is 100.6 degrees F, her pulse 150, her respiratory rate 12, her blood pressure on arrival 205\/90, and her O2 saturation is 98%. On physical examination, the HEENT examination reveals a normocephalic head with no evidence of trauma on examination. The pupils are equal and round, weakly reactive to light. The pupils are 2 mm. The fundi cannot be visualized. The neck is supple. There are no step-offs noted. The chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. The heart has normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmur. The abdomen is protuberant, but soft and non-tender, without guarding, rebound, masses, or organomegaly. The extremities are grossly within normal limits. Grossly, there is no posturing; there are no Babinskis; the reflexes are about 1+ bilaterally. LABORATORY EVALUATION: The head CT is noted to be negative. The EKG reveals ST elevations in III and possibly aVF. The heart rate is approximately 130. The chest x-ray shows proper tube placement. The troponin I is 2.2, and is in the process of being repeated. The glucose is 174, the BUN 57, the creatinine 5.8, the sodium 137, the potassium 5.3, the chloride 101, the CO2 18. The CK is noted to be 920, and the CK-MB is 2.6%. The toxicology screen is negative. The troponin I again is 2.2. The urine toxicology is also noted to be negative. The white count is 14, the hemoglobin 11, the hematocrit 36, and the platelet count 350. The urinalysis shows 3+ blood. There are only 1-3 WBCs in the urine. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: The plan is to admit the patient to the Intensive Care Unit for further work-up and evaluation. An LP will be done in the Emergency Department, and following the LP, the patient will be sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: The diagnostic impression in the Emergency Department is seizure and coma of undetermined etiology. DISPOSITION (including condition on discharge): The patient will be admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit following her lumbar puncture. HB768\/1408 H.

History Obtained From: Patient, chart review\nHistory of Present Illness: This is a 79 year old woman with a long-standing history of RA on chronic immunosuppression (prednisone and now on methotrexate), DM-2 (HbA1c 5.5), previous history of leg surgeries with ?vasculitis, and prior history of cellulitis, who presents with a 1 week history erythema and swelling on right lower leg (anterior). Ms. Do has had two prior hospitalizations for cellulitis\/osteomyelitis. In 2104, she developed osteomyelitis following a fall, requiring surgery for debridment (right leg). In 2106, she was also admitted to Seymour Hospital with cellulitis of right leg and required a 2-week course of IV antibiotics. At this presentation, she has been in her usual state of health (ET 25 feet, limited by pain in legs, no dyspnea, no chest pain) until last Tuesday when she presented to her podiatrist for a corn removal (right foot). The podiatrist made an observation that she had some erythema on the dorsal part of the foot. She was not experiencing any pain. Over this past week, she noted that the erythema and some swelling had extended, now to include the anterior portion of the lower shin. She presented to EFHC for a follow-up appointment, and was treated with Keflex po. Her cellulitis failed to improve and she presented to her PCP for evaluation on the day of admission, and was directly admitted to OGH. She denies any new fevers or chills (patient is having almost daily night sweats, which have been partially relieved with standing Tylenol intake. These night sweats, along with the weight loss and anorexia are in the process of being worked up at this time). She has had no cough, nasal discharge, headaches, diarrhea, or dysuria\/burning. No recent trauma to the leg.\nPast Medical History:\nDiabetes On oral hypoglycemics, no history of insulin use Checks own FSG tid HbA1c - 5.5% (3\/07) Yearly eye exams, frequent podiatrist visits Hypertension - on two agents, no known history of CAD Rheumatoid arthritis 40+ year history Has been on chronic steroids - 25 years Methotrexate - several years Osteomyelitis - 2104 (left foot) Fallowing a fall and injury Vasculitis on legs with ulcers Leg cellulites - 2106 Right renal mass See on CT scan during a work-up for anorexia, weight loss, and night sweats To be biopsied by IR Chronic anemia - approximately monthly Aranesp injections - being evaluated at EFHC Osteoporosis Multiple fractures Spinal stenosis - s\/p rod fixation\/fusion TIA - 2106, no residual deficits Hyperlipidemia Secondary adrenal insufficiency - due to chronic steroid use Viral meningitis - 2106 Cataracts - bilateral surgeries\nSurgeries: Back fusion - 2098, 2099 Left knee replacement - 2082 Right knee replacement - 2081 Right hip replacement - 2070 Sigmoid resection secondary to obstruction - 2103 Reversal of colostomy - 2103 Cataract surgeries\nMedications: 1.

Normal-based gait. Labs: Recent labs pending Radiology: CT Scan: MILD SPLENOMEGALY WITH MULTIPLE DISCRETE SPLENIC LESIONS AND CALCIFIED FOCI. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS INCLUDES GRANULOMAS\/SARCOIDOSIS. ISOLATED LYMPHOMA IS ALSO A CONSIDERATION. ON IMAGING IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE THESE PATHOLOGIES. TWO DISCRETE LESIONS IN THE POSTERIOR CORTEX OF RIGHT KIDNEY ARE SUSPICIOUS FOR SOLID RENAL MASS OR HYPERDENSE CYST. Assessment\/Plan: This is a 79 year old woman with past medical history of DM-2, chronic immunosuppresion (steroid use), RA, HTN, h\/o leg ulcers, cellulitis and osteomyelitis, who presents with a 1 week history of left lower extremity swelling and erythema, without other symptomatic complaints, that has been resistant to po treatment 1. Cellulitis - this woman is predisposed to cellulitis for a number of reasons, including chronic immunosuppression, diabetes, and prior surgeries to the area that have altered the anatomy and blood supply and lymphatic drainage. Other potential causes include osteo or DVT. At this point, there is little to suspect osteo in this patient. a. Blood cultures b. Given her multiple problems, requires broad spectrum coverage - Zosyn 2.25 g IV q6 h (CrCl 45) c. Elevate the leg d. Warm compresses to increased circulation e. Mark the extent of cellulitis and monitor progression with therapy f. If cellulitis does not improve - will get imaging to evaluate for underlying infection. Will also get LENIS to rule out a DVT. 2. Weight loss, anorexia, night sweats, now with R kidney mass - the differential for potential causes is very broad. She apparently had a negative PPD last year. Extensive work-up to date was only notable for kidney cysts and mass a. Will attempt to schedule IR-guided biopsy b. Will stop ASA, plavix and celebrex in anticipation of the biopsy c. Continue to monitor fever curve 3. Diabetes - patient is taking in normal diet, however in the setting of infection, will put of home meds and do RISS\/FSG 4. HTN - continue Lisinopril 5. RA - continue Prednisone and Methotrexate a. Blood cultures (in the setting of patient's infection) b. Monitor fever curve and other vitals signs carefully 6. Adrenal insufficiency - given patient's long term history of steroid use, she will need stress doses if becomes more acutely ill 7. Prophylaxis - Nexium 20 qd; Fragmin 2500 U sc qd 8. Code - DNI but wants chest compressions for a while.

Do is an 81-year-old right-handed white woman with seropositive, nodular, erosive rheumatoid arthritis that was diagnosed in 2060, type II noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, vascular insufficiency in her legs, peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss in her left ear, right total hip arthroplasty surgery in 2070, right total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2081, left total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2082, a lumbar fusion performed in 2098 and again in 2099, a sigmoid colonic resection in 2103, cellulitis and osteomyelitis involving her right foot in October 2104, a cataract extracted from her right eye in 2102, a cataract extracted from her left eye in 2103, a transient ischemic attack in June 2106, and cellulitis involving her legs in 2107. She returns to see me in rheumatologic follow-up at Rheumatology, this morning. Ms. Do has continued to take prednisone 5 mg by mouth twice daily, Celebrex 200 mg by mouth twice daily, and methotrexate 17.5 mg by mouth weekly, with good control of her joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. She continues to have difficulty grasping objects with her right hand, dropping objects that are held in that hand. She also experiences numbness in her right ring and little fingers. She wears a neutral resting splint on her right wrist for symptoms that she ascribes to right carpal tunnel syndrome. She has opted not to undergo surgical treatment of her right ulnar neuropathy, after consultation with Dr. Kyron M. Castaneda of the hand surgery service at OGH. She has experienced inadequate treatment of her pain on Darvocet-N 100 two tablets taken by mouth once daily.\nShe has continued to tolerate methotrexate therapy without symptoms of significant toxicity. She has not experienced skin rashes, fevers, chills, sores in her nose or mouth, hair loss, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.\nShe has continued to tolerate prednisone therapy without adverse symptoms other than for fragility of her skin and easy bruisability.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs BP 148\/60, P 64, RR 16, Temp 98.7 F, Wt 144 lb Ms. Do was a very pleasant, cushingoid-appearing white woman in some distress due to pain. Her skin was notable for ecchymoses on her extremities. There was a healed skin graft on her left lower leg. Well-healed scars were present over the lateral aspect of her right hip and over the anterior aspect of each knee. There were no skin rashes. Subcutaneous nodules, consistent with rheumatoid nodules, were present over the extensor surfaces of both elbows. Her lungs were clear to auscultation. Her cardiac examination revealed normal first and second heart sounds without murmurs or extra sounds. Her musculoskeletal examination was notable for pain upon abduction and external rotation of her left shoulder. There was ulnar deviation of the fingers of her right hand. There was a boutonniere deformity of her left ring finger. Bilateral hallux valgus deformities and cock-up toe deformities were present on both feet. There was full painless motion of all small and large joints in both arms and legs without evidence of joint inflammation or of other significant joint deformity. Her neurologic examination was notable for decreased sensation to light touch in the distribution of her right ulnar nerve, but was otherwise normal. Her neurologic examination was normal with normal mental status, normal function of cranial nerves II through XII, normal muscle strength and tone in both arms and legs, intact sensation to light touch throughout, normal coordination, and symmetric deep tendon reflexes with downgoing plantar reflexes bilaterally. LABORATORY DATA: I reviewed the laboratory data in the LMR with Ms. Do. Studies performed at OGH on Jun 04, 2109, revealed ESR 19 mm\/hr, CRP 10.6 mg\/L, a benign urinalysis, ANA 1:80 with a speckled pattern of immunofluorescence, rheumatoid factor 165 IU\/mL, and IgG anti-CCP antibodies 129 units.\nIMPRESSION: 1. Nodular, erosive rheumatoid arthritis since 2060, without evidence of synovitis on prednisone 5 mg p.o. b.i.d, Celebrex 200 mg p.o. b.i.d, and methotrexate 17.5 mg p.o. weekly. She continues to be most limited by her right hand dysfunction and right ulnar neuropathy, but has opted to treat this conservatively. 2. Low back pain, treated with epidural corticosteroid injection on Jun 02, 2109. 3. Type II noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n4. Vascular insufficiency in her legs.\n5. Peripheral neuropathy.\n6. Hearing loss in her left ear.\n7. Right total hip arthroplasty surgery in 2070.\n8. Right total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2081.\n10. Left total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2082.\n11. Lumbar fusion performed in 2098 and again in 2099.\n12. Sigmoid colonic resection in 2103.\n13. Cellulitis and osteomyelitis involving her right foot in October 2104.\n14. Cataract extracted from her right eye in 2102.\n15. Cataract extracted from her left eye in 2103.\n16. Transient ischemic attack in June 2106.\n17. Cellulitis involving her legs in 2107.\nRECOMMENDATIONS: I discussed my impressions with Ms. Do. I suggested that she increase her frequency of Darvocet-N 100 dosing to 2 tablets taken by mouth every 6 hours, as needed for pain control. She will withhold a Tylenol dose, when she takes Darvocet N-100. She will continue taking her other medications at their present doses. Laboratory studies will be performed today to assess her CBC, WBC differential count, plasma creatinine, ALT, AST, serum albumin, ESR, and CRP. Ms. Do will return to see me on December 11, 2109, at 9:40 a.m, so that I may assess her response to continued treatment and make any necessary changes in therapy.\nTibor Oquinn, M.D.\ncc:\nOrelia D.

Five days PTA, the Pt became SOB while walking up the stairs to his apartment on the 3rd floor. He took a SL NG pill which he says alleviated the SOB and allowed him to continue. Over the next few days, his SOB became progressively worse and occurred at rest. His SOB would awaken him from his sleep, occurring 3-4x\/ night. He states that SL NG pills alleviated his PND. The Pt sleeps on one pillow. During the course of his worsening SOB, his exercise tolerance decreased from a baseline of walking 2.5 hours without any SOB to walking for 1.5 hours with multiple stops due to SOB. These episodes of SOB were not associated w\/ CP (pleuritic or otherwise), palpitations, F\/C, N\/V, diaphoresis, abdominal discomfort, or pain in his arms or jaw.\n\nAlso during this time, the Pt noted progressive b\/l swelling of his legs (from ankles to knees) and increasing abdominal girth. He states that his legs would pit when he pressed on them. The LE swelling were not associated w\/ calf pain. On the day before admission, however, he did develop a non-productive, dry cough. On the DOA, his Sx had worsened to the point where he felt like he needed to be seen by a doctor. He was subsequently driven to NYSH-East by his wife and son, where he was seen and then re-directed to NYSH.\n\nAt NYSH-East, the Pt's vitals were: T 97.6 P 52-55 BP 167\/77 O2Sat 98% Wt 188.5# w\/ clothes.\nThe Pt received Lasix 40mg IV and O2 @ 3L\/min.\n\nAt NYSH-Ed, the Pt's vitals were: P 48 BP 157\/78 RR 20 O2Sat 99% on 2L\nThe Pt received ASA 325mg PO.\nSince receiving the Lasix, the Pt's LE edema has drastically diminished, and the Pt states that he feels a lot better.\n\nThe Pt has not experienced any recent weight loss and is on a regular diet without salt restriction (he uses salt 2-3x\/wk).

Although, there were no\nCP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs. Consider D-dimer to rule out recent PE.\nIschemia - EKG and the negative set of cardiac enzymes x2 does not suggest this. However, Pt\nhas not had any acute Sx while on the floor.\nPNA - This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC.\nTumor - This is also less likely given the lack of weight loss, the acute nature of the symptoms,\nand the lacko f lymphadenopathy.\n\n1) SOB - Most likely CHF>PE\/DVT>ischemia>>PNA,tumor; however, he currently appears asymptomatic. PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out, although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs, and the onset was not acute. The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely; however, the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility. PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss.\n\nWill start the Pt on O2 in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE-I. Will consider the addition of spironolactone. Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any. Order LFT's to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs. Monitor UOP for kidney functions. Monitor EKG for any changes. Will send for a D-dimer to r\/o recent PE.\n\n2) HTN - Poorly controlled, may be 2o to missing meds today. Will also be treated using meds for CHF.\n3) DM - Sugars elevated. Will treat w\/ his home medication of glucophage and glyburide.\n4) Hyperlipidemia - Stable. Cont home medication of Lipitor.\n5) FEN - Switch to low salt diet with no concentrated sweet. Consider a diabetic diet as well.\n6) Dispo - Will d\/c once Pt is stabilized.\n\nWillie Nix, TMS III\nPager: 20243\n\n\n\n\n12\/10\/94 Intern addendum:\n\nPatient seen and examined with med student above. Agree with overall assessment above. Briefly:\n\nThis is a 73M with a hx of CAD s\/p MI, s\/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days. DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine. Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2\/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities. Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.\n\nFavor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE. CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this. Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy.\n\nPlan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress. D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.\n\n\n\n\nNoah Escobar, MD, PhD\nInternal Medicineintern\nPager #08163\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2076-06-19\nPhysical exam - Male\n\nPatient is a 45 yo M who presents for yearly physical exam.

She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease, but has a long history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago, when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort. She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission, when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath. She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new-onset ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well. There was also poor R-wave progression V1 through V3. She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 30 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure. She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation. There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex. The right coronary artery was small with a 70% proximal stenosis. The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug-eluting stent. She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 20 mmHg. She had an estimated 70% ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis. Cardiac index was 2.5 with SVR of 1739. She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation.\nHer past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 40 mg q.d. and atenolol 50 mg q.d. She also has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin. Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy.\nSocial history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use. She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country.\nReview of systems show no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting.\nOn exam, she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 160\/80 with a heart rate of 70 and regular. Followup pressure 125\/80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute. Head and neck were unremarkable. Chest is clear. Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees. PMI is normal. S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split. There is an S4 and a 1\/6 systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to 2\/6 holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border. There is no S3. Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly. Bowel sounds are normal. Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis. Calf site is clean without bruits. Distal pulse is decreased but palpable.\nHer resting 12-lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI.\nOther lab values included creatinine 1.0 with normal electrolytes, hematocrit is 44.4%, white blood cell count 3.8 with platelets 322,000. Liver function tests are normal.\nA portable chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema.\nMrs. Sergio-Steven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation. She has had her circumflex, which is a very large vessel, well treated now with a drug-eluting stent, and her wedge has come down, and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved.\nAt this point, we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin, Plavix, heparin, continue the Integrilin, as well as Lasix and nitrates. We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated, and also plan beta-blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands. She certainly has co-existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD. At this point, if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia, we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery.\n\n\nYakov Ferris, MD\nDictated By: Yakov Ferris\neScription document:5-4672574 BFFocus\n\nDD: 09\/03\/74 DT: 09\/03\/74 DV: 09\/03\/74\n\n* Record date: 2074-12-09\nFrancesca is a 72 y\/o woman here for f\/u abnormal lab tests done 11\/21.

The patient was in the\nEmergency Department today visiting a family member. She was\ncompletely asymptomatic, but had her blood pressure taken which\nshowed a pressure of 190\/98. The patient states that she usually\ntakes 9 cardiac and antihypertensive medicines but the\nprescriptions has run out and so for the past week or so, she has\nbeen taking only 4 of the 9. She is unable to say exactly which\nones. She denies any headache, visual changes, chest pain,\nshortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or lightheadedness.\nHer husband is the one in the Emergency Department today and\nthat is causing her some stress. Denies any rash, joint pain,\nback pain, polyuria, or polydipsia.\nPlease see the resident's note for details of the patient's past\nmedical history, surgical history, family history, review of\nsystems, and physical exam.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is awake, alert, in no distress with\nno complaints. Has a repeat blood pressure of 190\/95 and\nsaturating 99% on room air with a pulse of 70. Exam is\nremarkable for a systolic ejection murmur at the right upper\nsternal border of 3\/6. No JVD, with good and equal pulses.\nAbdomen is soft and nontender. She has no papilledema and fundal\nexam is clear. Neurologically, she is oriented x3 with normal\nmood and affect.\nIMAGING STUDIES: EKG shows first-degree AV block with an old\nLAD. This is considered normal for this patient and is unchanged\nfrom before. Urinary dip is negative.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient's usual pharmacy is\ncontacted. Correct doses of her medications are obtained and\nrefills for 2 weeks were given. She is told to follow up with\nher primary care physician within 2 weeks. She says she will be\nable to do that and remains asymptomatic throughout her Emergency\nDepartment stay.

Sylvester, Jr, M.D. Holden District Hospital 62 Ferry Road Cardiology Foxborough, TX 58771\nDear Ken:\nMr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal. He tolerated the procedure uneventfully. His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy. He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge. He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home. Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias. He is slowly recovering his overall strength.\nThe last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3.\nOn a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d, enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d, Niferex 150 mg p.o. q.d, p.r.n. Tylenol No. 3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o. q.d, Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d, Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. q.d, Pletal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d, possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q.d.\nPhysical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress. Blood pressure right arm sitting 110\/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds. The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits. Chest is clear. Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1\/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub. The abdomen is benign. Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.\nElectrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees. There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes. An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate. No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.\nImpression and Plan: Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery. I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm. I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued. At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin. In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention. In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center. I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction. He will have routine blood studies obtained today. I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range. Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen.\nThank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.\nSincerely yours,\n\n\nNicholas Gomes, M.D.\nDictated By: Nicholas Gomes\neScription document:5-3575980 AFFocus\n\nDD: 09\/13\/93 DT: 09\/14\/93 DV: 09\/13\/93\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2120-10-23\nPatient Name: FLAHERTY, XAVIER; MRN: 1935081 Dictated on: 10\/23\/2120 by ROSITA KO, M.D.\nThe patient is a 72-year-old male, paraplegic, referred for evaluation of recurrent bladder infections. The patient has persistent presence of bacteria in his urine and there is a concern that he might have a persistent source of infection. The patient denies fevers, chills, sweats, decrease in energy, loss of appetite, pain in the lower abdomen or penile discharge. He reports there is some soreness around the meatus, which he attributes to self-catheterizing he is required to do 3 times a day. He is well educated in terms of cleaning around the side and the appropriate way to do self-catheterization. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes, hypertension, paraplegia secondary to unclear disk problems in 2107, right hip ulcer with trochanteric osteomyelitis in December 2118, treated with Unasyn x6 weeks and debridement and surgical flap, sacral decubiti in 2119 treated with Unasyn x6 weeks, local debridement healing by secondary intention. No history of kidney stones. SOCIAL: Ex-tobacco use 2-3 packs per day, quit 25 years. Alcohol prior heavy use, quit 25 years. Lives alone. Prior work included Heavy-Duty Equipment Mechanic, Ironworker, as well as Electric Appliance Servicer. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS: Blood pressure medication, name unknown. Metformin. Note, patient had been on Bactrim prophylaxis over the spring. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 150\/100, heart rate 100, temperature 97.9.

Valladares, M.D.\nMedical Director\nJanuary 27, 2089\n\nMedical Record Number: 8751045 Francisco, Xue\n\nProcedure: The patient is a 56-year-old Spanish-speaking female scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgery is scheduled on January 28, 2089 by Dr. Xavier Israel kenneth Xenos.\n\nChief Complaint & Present Illness: Patient briefly evaluated on 12\/30\/88 as part of preoperative evaluation for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy then scheduled for 12\/31\/88. Over the past year patient has had difficulty with right upper quadrant pain as well as epigastric pain. These episodes tend to happen more frequently after she has had a rich meal. Other symptoms that occurred include nausea and vomiting. Patient denies jaundice. Today, patient states that she still has some abdominal tenderness greatest at the right costal margin and radiating into right flank.\n\nAt the time of evaluation on 12\/30\/88 patients had symptoms of URI and LRI. She reported back\/green sputum, mild shortness of breath and increased use of her grandson's inhaler. After consultation with Dr. Valladares it was decided that patient should be evaluated by her primary care provider for further treatment of her respiratory tract infection and then follow-up with surgeon to reschedule her surgery. Patient reports that she went to University Hospital and there they treated her with antibiotics and inhaler. Unfortunately patient is unable to recall the name of the antibiotic or the inhaler. Currently she denies any symptoms of sputum production, cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Also denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nPatient does have a history of coronary artery disease. She is status post an MI 11\/82. Patient had cardiac catheterization at OSH 12\/3\/82 that reportedly showed a critical mid right lesion and a mild left main and left anterior descending lesion. 12\/09\/82 patient underwent cardiac catheterization at PVH and a PTCA was done. Patient did well until 10\/83 when she was admitted to PVH with symptoms of chest tenderness, left arm pain, tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, dry mouth, shortness of breath, dizziness, and darkening of revision. Patient did rule out for MI by serial enzymes and there are no changes seen on her ECG. Patient denies any difficulty with chest pain or left arm pain since that time. She has had episodes of shortness of breath with exertion however, these seem more related to her respiratory status rather than her cardiac disease.\n\nStress test done 1\/26 showed a normal exercise capacity (METS=7), ECG nondiagnostic for ischemia and the perfusion images were suggestive of anterior ischemia although body habitus limited the interpretation.\n\n\n\nPast Medical History: Significant medical problems include:\n1. Hypertension\n2. CAD, status post MI 2082, status post PTCA 2082\n3. Asthma (no hospitalizations or intubations)\n4. Arthritis\n5. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (with clinical manifestations of arthralgia, TTP and a high urine titer)\n6. Chronic low back pain, history of herniated discs\n7. Depression\n\nPast Surgical History: Prior surgery includes:\n1. Status post cardiac catheterization and PTCA, 9\/82\n2. Status post D&C secondary to prolonged menstrual bleeding\n3.

It has only been three-week since her infection and therefore increased airway reactivity may be an issue. Dr. Hoffman explained this to patient. Dr. Hoffman also reviewed with patient medications to take prior to surgery 1\/28\/89. Currently, patient denies any symptoms of cardiac ischemia.

Pt reported that pain has been lasting anywhere from 20 min to 1 hour and that it emanates from the L sternal border with radiation to L lateral thorax and radiation to L arm, accompanied by tingling\/numbness in L digits + occasionally right digits, as well as down the L leg. In PVH ED, pt describes the pain as like a bleeding scar and states my heart is bloated through her daughter who acted as her interpreter. She reports that the pain, at it's worst is 5\/10, but has improved to 2\/10 after NTG en route to the ED and once in the ED. She affirms nausea and diaphoresis accompany pain. Pain has no relationship to position or activity -- has occurred during sitting, ambulation, and reclining. Pt lives on the second story of her building and has noted that walking up stairs has been been more difficult over the past two weeks secondary to calf and ankle pain, L > R, follow by chest pain. Pt has not had to use more pillows in the past two weeks when sleeping, and reports no change in the number of times per week that she wakes up short of breath, which varies between one to two times per week. Pt denies increased swelling in extremities over the past two weeks or increase in weight.\n\nAllergies\n* Celebrex - SOB : that triggered her asthma\n\nMedications\nAspirin (ACETYLSALICYLIC Acid) 81 MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO QD\nCalcium Gluconate 500MG, 2 Tablet(s) PO x1\nVitamin D (ERGOCALCIFEROL) PO QD\nNitroglycerin 1\/150 (0.4 Mg) 1 TAB SL : PRN\nVioxx (ROFECOXIB) 25MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO QD PRN leg pain\nNifedipine (EXTENDED Release) 90MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO QD\nHYDROXYCHLOROQUINE 200MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO BID x 30 day(s)\nATENOLOL 50MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO QD\nProtonix (PANTOPRAZOLE) 40MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO QD x 30 day(s)\nPREDNISONE 10MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO QD x 30 day(s)\nIsosorbide Dinitrate 30MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO QD\n\nSocial History\nPt originally from Hawley, Puerto Rico.

Chest Pain: Likely musculoskeletal in nature given reproducibility of pain on palpation. However, given pt's cardiac history, will obtain two more sets of cardiac markers. Adenosine stress test scheduled for a.m. with echocardiogram pending, as well. Pt's Atenenlol switched to Lopressor during admission. Pt Dilatrate-SR changed to Isordil. Continuing home meds of Nifedipine and ASA. Pt to be NPO after midnight for am cardiac testing.\n\n2. SLE: Continuing home dose of prednisone, as well as Vitamins C and D. Will notify Dr. Xie that pt is in-house per request of PCP, to determine if any further Rheum w\/u is necessary.\n\n3. GI: Will repeat amylase and lipase. Prednisone is a known cause of pancreatitis and pt's continued abdominal complaints may be pancreatic in origin. although unlikely as elevation is minimal.\n\n\nOlivia H.

Pain is an aching quality, minimally alleviated by tylenol, exacerbated by moving rotating shoulder. Does not have frozen shoulder or sensation of morning stiffness. She is able to continue all IADL activities requiring use of the joint but notes the pain has become increasingly bothersome. She notes no weakness of her R arm, no dysesthesias or paresthesias, swelling, or history of injury.\nShe has noted burning pain in lower extremities, stocking distribution x 1 year. She has pain described as pins from bottom of foot extending up both legs. She has a burning sensation of both legs that she notices particularly at night. Walking does not exacerbate or alleviate this sensation. She has not used anything to relieve the discomfort.

CAD.\nPt had negative stress MIBI in 12\/91 and has not had cardiology follow up for multiple years. She is being referred to the Internal Medicine ward service for consultation. Specifically, she remains on a nitrate (isordil) which may exacerbate GERD.

Will check X-ray, get PA for Vioxx, and would benefit from PT referral. If no improvement, consider MRI vs empiric subacromial\/?A-C joint steroid injection.\nSeems to have a painful peripheral neuropathy, cause uncertain. Will try low-dose TCA, would also check B12, consider EMG\/NCV.\nWill obtain cardiology review for CAD. Regardless of level of lipids, there is evidence for benefit of statin, and would encourage pt to resume. If current chest pain syndrome more likely due to GERD than ischemia, could consider D\/C nitrates.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2093-01-28\n\nProblems\nHealth maintenance\nDepression : Per daughter, depression significant component of back pain.

He came back from Pennsylvania after being there about a month. He has had an eventful past six months. In October, he apparently had a TIA or small stroke. He was evaluated with an MRA of his neck and was told that there was not enough blockage to warrant surgery. His symptomatology fortunately clear. His symptoms were related to loss of feeling in his right upper extremity. About this time, he also developed a traumatic lesion of the left second toe. He apparently develops some cellulitis and was treated with ampicillin. Not long after this, he went into renal failure. He was told that they could not tell if that was due to the antibiotics or the gadolinium. According to the patient and his wife, his creatinine went as high as 9. Fortunately, it is currently back down to 2.4.\nHis toe lesion has been very slow to improve. He describes pain in the toe and often has to sleep in a chair with his foot dependent. He has seen various physicians and podiatrists in Pennsylvania, without much improvement. They finally told him, he would do well to come back here for further care and evaluation.\nOn examination today, I can feel femoral and popiteal pulses. I do not feel any definite pedal pulses on either side but noninvasive study show good pulsatile flow at the calf and transmetatarsal level. Resting ABI is good, although his diabetic calcinosis probably makes this unreliable. He has some slight pulsatile flow at the right toe level and flat tracings at left toes. He has 1 cm escharover the dorsum of his second toe. There is some erythema of the toe and proximal dorsal forefoot. This certainly has the appearance of some cellulites. There is minimal to no swelling of the toe.\nWe will place him on Keflex 250 mg q.i.d. for 7 to 10 days to see if this helps with any possible associated cellulitis. I will refer him to Dr. Caldwell for recommendations regarding wound quick care and an opinion whether or not hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be worth considering. I do not think there is anything further we can do to improve his distal blood flow. Further imaging will also be very difficult in view of the possible problems with gadolinium as well as his creatinine, which limit contrast administration. His noninvasive studies suggest that his problems are all diabetic small vessel disease and it is unlikely that we could be of benefit with this. I will await Dr. Caldwell&#8217;s opinions.\n\n\n* Record date: 2105-08-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVascular Surgery\/Emergency Department Surgical Admission Note\n\n\nPatient: Jorgenson, Andrew C.\nMRN: 9125902\nDate: 8\/11\/05\n\nCC: cool right foot and progressive claudication\n\nHPI: The patient is a 74 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD s\/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass with PTFE (5\/00) who presents to the ED with right foot pain.\n\nThe patient has developed progressive R calf pain over the past 2 months, which has become worse over the past 10 days. He is unable to walk more than a half block without cramping pain in his calf. Because of his previous bypass surgery and current complaints, he underwent vascular studies today demonstrating critical atherosclerotic disease in the RLE, with markedly reduced flow through the R graft. The toe-brachial index was not able to be calculated on the R, and was 0.31 on the L. He is currently taking ASA 325 mg po daily, but no plavix or Coumadin.\n\nOver the past week, the patient reports that his pain has become more severe.

The case was complicated by large blood loss anemia and hypotension. In the PACU the patient continued to be hypotensive and have low uop. We placed a central line (starting CVP was 0) and continued resuscitation. The patient developed ST changes and also had acute on chronic renal failure (RIFLE F). WE transfused and transferred him to the ICU. We discussed this at length with the surgical service as well as cardiology. I examined the patient reviewed the chart and discussed the case. I agree with history and exam as outlined in residents note Issues: Cardiac ischemia: Ischemia was mostly due to hypotension and low HGB as well as tachycardia. Will give aspirin and lower HR to 70's with Beta blockers. Contue statin. Willt ransfuse to HGB around 10 and continue to check troponins Decreased myocardial function: he has low central venous saturation and increased lactate. Will give fluids and transfuse the patient. Will get echo in am. If his central venous sat and lactate does not signficantly improve with these measures would stay away from inotropes for now given his rate related ischemia Acute blood-loss naemia: will transfuse to Metabolic acidosis: the patetin has signifcant metabolic acidosis. We will for now give volume. Acute renal failure: He has significantly decreaed uop. We are sending urine lytes and casts. Will increase filling pressures. For now would not use furosemide given low central filling pressures. V.

He has been feeling pretty well though he is\ndistressed at his 18-pound weight gain. His sugars were in the 300s before starting\nthe insulin. Since he started the insulin, his sugars have come down nicely. His\nfasting sugars have been in the 120s. His afternoon sugars have been in the 70-90s.\nHe had a few hypoglycemic episodes early on but has not had some in almost a\nmonth. Other than that, he really has no new complaints. He is still not smoking.\nHe is still on the patch. His neuropathy has not gotten any worse and he thinks he\ncan stop the Neurontin now. He has not had any shortness of breath, cough or\nedema.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above. No GI symptoms, no GU symptoms and no\nnew skin symptoms, no arthritic complaints.\n\nHABITS: Not smoking or drinking. Not getting much exercise now.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: His blood pressure is 140\/80 on the left, 150\/80 on the right.\nHis pulse is 76 and regular. Respirations are 16. Lungs are clear. Heart: Regular\nrate and rhythm, negative M\/R\/G. No bruits heard. Nasopharynx unremarkable.\nAbdomen is benign. He has diminished pulses but good capillary refill in the feet.\nThe cellulitis on the left ankle is completely resolved. He has some neuropathy of\nthe feet with decreased sense to vibration in both feet, but his sensation to\nmonofilament is intact on both feet.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\n(1) Diabetes. Will check his hemoglobin A1c today. It may still be a little bit\nhigh as he has undergone a rather brisk change since starting his insulin. I\nencouraged him to check his sugars a couple times a week, especially in the\nafternoon. If he continues to get low sugars, will cut back on his morning\ninsulin to 35 units. He is going to bring in a form for custom shoes given his\nneuropathy and is followed closely by Podiatry. He had an eye exam earlier\nthis year with Dr. Yousif.\n\n(2) Hypertension. Will increase his Mavik to 4 mg a day.\n\n(3) Hyperlipidemia. Recheck lipids and SGOT today.\n\n(4) CAD prevention. He can't take aspirin so we will start Plavix 75 mg a day.\n\n(5) Status-post splenectomy. He needs a Pneumovax booster 0.5 cc was given in\nthe left deltoid.\n\n\nScott Phipps, M.D.\n\nSP\/irons\/quang\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2070-03-16\n\nNAME: Vines, Stephen MRN: 1672569\nStephen comes in today. He has been feeling pretty well. Really has no new complaints. He still has 5 block claudication in his calves and he continues to smoke a half pack per day. His neuropathy is stabilized and his sugars have been good for the most part in the 140-150 range on insulin. His weight has been stable. He has had no shortness of breath or chest pain and his review of systems is otherwise negative.\nHABITS: Smokes about a half pack per day. Does not drink, not really getting much exercise. His legs hurt only when he walks over 5 blocks. It doesn't hurt when he is working in the McCormick Company.\nPHYSICAL EXAM: He looks well. His blood pressure is 142\/80. His pulse is 74 and regular. Respirations are 16. Lungs are clear. No worrisome skin lesions. No bruits. 1+ carotids. Abdomen is soft and nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly, no pulsatile masses, no bruits. Decreased pulses in the feet and decreased capillary refill and decreased sensation of vibration and fine touch.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n(1) Diabetes. Will check his hemoglobin A1c to see where we stand. Continue on his current regimen. Encouraged him to increase his exercise and watch his diet. He has an eye exam scheduled. His feet look okay, though we will have to be careful given his neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease.\n(2) Claudication. Once again, talked to Mr. Vines about the absolute importance of quitting smoking. He is going to try using the Wellbutrin. Gave him a prescription for #60. He will take one a day for 3-4 days and then go up to 1 p.o. b.i.d. He has no contraindications. I also encouraged him to use the patch. Hopefully, we will be able to get him off the cigarettes. I also encouraged him to walk until it hurts at least 3-4 x a day to try and train his legs.\n(3) Hypertension. Our goal is to get his blood pressure down about 130. Will increase the Mavik to twice a day.\n(4) Hyperlipidemia. Well controlled on Lipitor. Recheck his lipids.\n(5) Neuropathy. Stable. He doesn't feel the need for any medication for it.\n(6) HPDP. Will check his guaiac cards. He is not interested in a sigmoidoscopy. He has had a Pneumovax. Patient will follow up with me in 3 months.\n\nScott Phipps, M.D.\nSP\/irons\/quang\n\n* Record date: 2072-10-29\nCCU JAR Admit Note\nName: Stephen Vines\nUnit#: 1672569\nAdmit Date: 10\/29\/72\n\nCC: CP\n\nHPI: Pt is a 69 y\/o man w\/ cardiac risk factors of DM, smoking? hyperlipidemia who had been feeling chest discomfort for 3 d PTA similar to his usual GERD and was relieved with mylanta.

Nursing note\nalso reports decreased urine output for the last 2 days. He had\na KUB done at the referring facility that demonstrated a question\nof a small bowel obstruction but this film was not sent with him.\nHe also had a fever today per report. The patient denies any\nabdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, or other\ncomplaints. He does have a history of an ileus and prior\nadmissions for urosepsis with levofloxacin resistant E. coli. He\nreports a mild cough.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for hypertension, multiple\nsclerosis, anemia, decubitus ulcers, neurogenic bladder, and\nurethral strictures.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He is status post urethral stenting.\nSocial history, family history, and review of systems are as per\nwritten note.\nMEDICATIONS: Prozac, Actonel, ferrous sulfate, aspirin,\nmultivitamins, lisinopril, Lipitor, and Prilosec.\nALLERGIES: None.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is awake and alert, generally\nchronically ill appearing, quite pleasant. Vital signs are\nwithin normal limits as documented except for an elevated pulse\nrate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24, room air\nsaturations of 93% and a temperature of 99.2. For full physical\nexam findings, please see the resident's written note.\nSpecifically, HEENT exam is atraumatic. There is a 1-cm ulcer on\nroof of his mouth. He has synechiae of his pupils that are 2 mm\nand nonreactive. His extraocular movements are not alignment.\nNeck exam is normal as documented. Respiratory exam reveals\nscattered bronchi. There is no chest wall tenderness.\nCardiovascular exam reveals tachycardia without murmur.\nAbdominal exam is distinctly distended and slightly firm with\nhypoactive bowel sounds but no tenderness, no rebound or\nguarding. Skin is intact, warm, and dry on my exam.\nMusculoskeletal exam is nontender with no edema or bony point\ntenderness. Neurologically, the patient has increased tone in\nhis lower extremities and weakness of all of his extremities.\nHis mood and affect is normal but he is dysarthric. He is\nneurologically, however, appears to be at his baseline.\nLABORATORY DATA: CBC and electrolytes remarkable for white blood\ncount 16.2, BUN and creatinine ratio of 40 and 1.0 respectively.\nLast creatinine was 0.5. LFTs and lipase are within normal\nlimits as documented. INR is 1.1.\nIMAGING STUDIES: EKG demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific\nST-T wave changes. Plain films of the abdomen demonstrates\nscattered dilated loops of small bowel but no clear obstruction\nconsistent with possible ileus versus early obstruction. Chest\nx-ray shows low lung volumes without any focal consolidation.\nIMPRESSION: This is a patient with abdominal distention, is\nquite impressive as well as a firm belly with dilated loops of\nbowel on his KUB as well as history of vomiting earlier this\nevening. He has had no vomiting here and does not feel\nnauseated, however, does not have an appetite. He has had\ndecreased urine output and managed to put out a total 25 cc of\nurine through his Foley since 2:00 p.m. today. Presently, he was\nnot tender over his bladder. Upon flushing the Foley, there is a\nlarge amount of debris. They came out and followed by high\npressure urine that had malodorous character to it. I think this\npatient likely has an ileus and urinary tract infection. He\nreceived antibiotics wide spectrum including vancomycin,\nlevofloxacin and Flagyl initially followed by gentamicin given\nhis prior levofloxacin resistance.\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Urinary tract infection.\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Ileus versus SBO.\nThe patient was admitted to the ED Observation Area for CT\nimaging, however will eventually require admission for this\nproblem likely to Medicine Service.\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to ED Observation Unit.\n\nBENSON, KAILEE MD\nD: 10\/15\/92\nT: 10\/15\/92\nDictated By: BENSON, KAILEE\neScription document:7-8396761 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2093-08-09\nEDVISIT^03689964^VALENZUELA, BRIAN^08\/09\/93^BOYER, DAWN\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Fever.\nI saw this patient with Dr. Edwards.

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined\nthe patient, reviewed the resident's documentation, and\ndiscussed, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.\nHistory is obtained through discussion with the patient who says\nyes or no, as well as transporting paramedics.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old\ngentleman with end-stage MS at nursing home. He has indwelling\nFoley catheter. He was transported from nursing home to ED as he\nhas had a fever today to approximately 100.5. Per EMS, they were\ntold that the patient has also been more lethargic with decreased\nPOs today. He received Tylenol and defervesced somewhat. He\nthen received 400 mL of fluid en route and he has become more\nawake and alert. He is telling the paramedics that he is at his\nbaseline. He denies to me any headaches, neck pain. No chest\npain, shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no cough, no fevers\nor chills. He reports that he is able to discern when he has\nabdominal pain. He has intact sensation.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As per HPI. In addition, CAD, diabetes,\nhypertension, CHF.\nPlease see resident note for list of medication and allergies.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke. He does not drink. He is at\na nursing home. He is married.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per resident note and my HPI.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is awake, alert, and nontoxic, in no\ndistress. Afebrile, pulse in 90s, respiratory 18, blood pressure\n102\/66, O2 saturation 99% on room air. HEENT exam:\nNormocephalic and atraumatic. Neck: Supple. He has coarse\nupper airway sounds bilaterally anteriorly. Heart is regular\nrate and rhythm. His abdomen is slightly distended. He is\nnontender. He has sacral decubitus ulcers that are well healing,\nno evidence of acute infection, contractures in his lower\nextremities. He is alert and does say yes or no to questions.\nThe most likely etiology in this patient for an infection is his\nurinary tract infection. His urine and his catheter was cloudy.\nPrior to sending the urine for evaluation for urinalysis to the\nlab, the patient had his catheter changed. He then began to no\nlonger drain urine. Accordingly, a bladder probe was put on\nusing ultrasound and clearly showed a distended bladder.\nAttempts were made to change the catheter, but they were\nunsuccessful. There was pus found at the meatus. At this point,\nthe patient is awaiting a CT scan of his abdomen and urology\nevaluation. He is also receiving antibiotics for presumed UTI\nand\/or abscess.\nLABORATORY DATA: Include sodium 136, K 4.5, chloride 102,\nbicarbonate 22, BUN 22, creatinine 0.45, and glucose 136. LFTs\nwithin normal limits. Normal lipase. White count of 5.7,\nhematocrit 35.5, and platelet count 306,000. Coags within normal\nlimits. UA again is pending at this time.\nHe will be admitted to the hospital. I attempted to reach the\npatient's primary care physician, Dr. Earle to contact from the\nWBM office, however, my calls went unanswered. At this point, I\nam signing out the patient and he is awaiting his CT scan and\nurology evaluation.\nDIAGNOSIS: Urinary infection, mild dehydration, end-stage MS.\nCONDITION: Stable.\nDISPOSITION: Will be admitted.\n\nBOYER, DAWN MD\nD: 08\/09\/93\nT: 08\/10\/93\nDictated By: BOYER, DAWN\neScription document:6-1950972 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2094-10-23\nPatient: VALENZUELA,BRIAN 03689964Date of Admission: 10\/23\/2094 Attending: Davila\nInternal Medicine Intern Admit Note\nCC: fever, lethargy, confusion\nHPI: 57M who lives in NH and has h\/o severe MS-partially verbal at baseline, bedridden- recurrent UTIs and urosepsis with chronic indwelling foley, HTN, CAD,and CHF (EF 35-40%) who presents from NH with confusion, lethargy, and fever to 102.

Long, M.D. Glenn Helen Medical Group Glenn Helen Infirmary Algoma, CO 71183 RE: Roberta Vincent MR #380-18-32-2 Dear Dr. Long: Thank you for referring Ms. Roberta Vincent to the Renal Services Clinic. I had the pleasure of seeing her on November 16, 2092. Please allow me to summarize her history for our records. Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old mother of eight with chronic renal failure of unknown etiology. She is six years status post hysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult leiomyosarcoma was discovered. She has an extensive history of hidradenitis, obesity, and hypertension. She had one stillborn infant, one premature infant, and three spontaneous abortions. SFOC records are unavailable at this time. Her medications include Premarin 0.625 qd, Diltiazem 240 qd, furosemide 40 mg qd, Mevacor 20 mg qd, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg qd, Niferex 300 mg qd, Vitamin E 400 units qd, fish oil qd, and Keflex 250 mg qid. On physical examination Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old woman in no distress. Her weight is 101.5 kilograms, or 223 lbs. Temperature is normal. Pulse is 88 beats per minute. Blood pressure is 178\/96. There is striking hirsutism and moon facies. There is a buffalo hump. The lungs show scattered wheezing. Cardiovascular exam is normal. There are discolorations of the skin across the neck, upper extremities, and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not raised. The abdomen is obese without palpable masses. There is a ventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen. The extremities show trace edema. There are several areas of superficial petechiae. In summary, this 56-year-old woman has chronic renal failure of unclear etiology. She does report an episode of lower extremity swelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis. ThisRoberta Vincent MR #380-18-32-2 -2- November 16, 2092 raises the possibility of a post-infectious glomerulonephritis now in a chronic phase. Other diagnostic possibilities include other forms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus erythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions. Nevertheless, I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this time given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased risk due to her body habitus. I discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms. Vincent. Although she has no medical conditions which would preclude living-related or cadaveric kidney transplantation, her obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of hidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option. I have encouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or transplantation. Nevertheless, her appearance is quite reminiscent of Cushing's disease, and this should be worked up if it has not been performed previously. I have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her kidney function and a follow-up appointment in two months' time to meet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV fistula or placement of a graft. Thank you once again for your kind referral. Respectfully, Elias Q. Mercado, M.D. S.

We will not repeat her history as you know it well. Over the past three months Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue, occasionally sleeping more than 12 hours per night, forgetfulness and tingling of the fingers and toes. She has maintained a relatively good appetite and denies nausea, vomiting or shortness of breath. An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 14, 2092 revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per minute, suggesting profound loss of renal function. On physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219 pounds. Blood pressure is 150\/90, pulse is 80 and regular. The lungs are clear. There is no peripheral edema. Again, there marked cushingoid features. Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. Vincent comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as facial hair over the past several months. In summary, Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of uremia. Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start dialysis within the next several months. We have arranged to recheck her chemistries today. We would also recommend that she undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features. Although renal failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional androgenic features in woman, this is beyond ordinary. Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.

She also complains of shortness of breath. She noted some nausea, but no vomiting. She had no other related symptoms. She has had no previous history of chest pain. She was given Nitroglycerin x 3 and this eventually relieved her pain. PAST MEDICAL\/SURGICAL HISTORY: Includes end-stage renal disease, coronary artery disease with a bypass graft but without any chest pain at the time, and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus which may account for her previous cardiac history without chest pain. ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN AND CODEINE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin and Xanax. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 164\/94, pulse 94, respirations 24, oxygen saturation 96%. GENERAL: The patient is comfortable in no acute distress. HEAD AND NECK: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal and reactive. Pharynx benign. Tongue is of normal shape and contour. Neck is supple. No jugular venous distention. LUNGS: Are clear bilaterally. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm. S1, S2, with no murmurs, rubs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema or rash. NEUROLOGICAL: Patient is alert and oriented x 3. She moves all extremities. Has symmetrical strength and all proximal and distal upper and lower motor bilaterally. Normal sensation to light touch grossly. LABORATORY: White blood cell count 9, hematocrit 41. Glucose was high at 533. However, she has bicarbonate of 24, so she is probably not in diabetic ketoacidosis. BUN 31, creatinine 3.8. Troponin-I was 0.5. Chest x-ray was negative. Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and non-specific ST\/T wave changes. Perhaps some ST depressions in II, III and AVF, and deep S waves in V1, 2, 3, and 4. TREATMENT RENDERED AND COURSE IN ED: In the hospital the patient did not have further chest pain here. She was admitted for chest pain and for rule out myocardial infarction to the Medical Service. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Rule out myocardial infarction DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): Admitted.

Patient was last seen in clinic in\n11-70 after which time she left for Ghana for the past six months. She\nreturned this past Friday but has since run out of insulin. She states\nthat she has been feeling well and has not had any problems but does not\nknow the amount of insulin that she has been taking. It has been\nadministered to her by a friend in Ghana. Our records show that when\nshe left Ghana she was on a 70\/30 of Humulin, 20 units per day and\nalso 600mg of Rezulin and 20mg q.d. of Lipitor.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems is positive for insulin dependent\ndiabetes mellitus but other than that Ms. Xian is a fairly healthy woman.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam this evening her pulse is 80. Blood\npressure was 152\/80 in her left arm. Blood sugar was 262. It should be\nnoted that she has not had any insulin since Sunday. Her weight was 116 1\/2\nwhich reflects a 1\/2 lb. weight loss since 11-70. Tonight her heart had a\nregular rate and rhythm at 80. Her neck veins were flat. Her lungs were\nclear to auscultation bilaterally and there was no evidence of peripheral\nedema.\n\nASSESSMENT: Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\nPLAN: LFTs, A1C, basic panel this evening. Glucotrol 10mg dispense No. 60\nwith 1 refill b.i.d. A VNA referral for medication management and patient\nwas instructed to return to the clinic on Saturday 6-05 for repeat blood\nsugar and also to bring her glucometer at that time so that it could be\ncalibrated correctly.\n\n\n\nGrace Vann, R.N.P.\n\nDG:WA:1749\nDD:5-31-71\nDT:6-1-71\nDV:5-31-71\n\n\n* Record date: 2072-07-30\n\nSCHLESWIG COUNTY CLINIC Walk-in clinic 24 Weld St Grandview, NE 13472\nXian, Imogene 64187177 07\/30\/72\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Ms. Xian is a 75-year-old female who presented to the walk-in clinic this evening as a walk-in with a chief complaint of bilateral foot pain especially in the toe area, and she says that this has been going on for approximately two months.\nALLERGIES: She denies any known drug allergies.\nMEDICATIONS: At present, she is taking Glucophage 500 mg one p.o. q.a.m, two p.o. q.p.m, Avandia 2 mg one p.o. q.a.m, Plavix 75 mg one p.o. q.d, glipizide 5 mg two p.o. q.a.m, and two p.o. q.p.m, and Lipitor 20 mg q.d.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient states that she has had constant pain in her toes and at times with a feeling of tingling. Otherwise, she states she has been feeling well. She denies any chest pain or heart palpitation. She denies any shortness of breath. She denies any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. She denies any frequency, dysuria or thirst. She has a history of non- insulin-dependent diabetes at this time.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her temperature was 98.5 degrees p.o, her pulse was 80, her blood pressure was 118\/60 in her right arm. Her weight was 117 pounds, which reflects a one-pound weight loss since her last visit. Her blood sugar, which was random, was 159, her last meal being at 12 noon. Her son, who accompanied her states that it is questionable whether she is taking her medications as instructed and voiced an interest in having his mother take insulin, which she has taken in the past. Her heart had a regular rate and rhythm at 80. There was no evidence of any peripheral edema. Examination of her toes revealed presence of some tinea interdigitally.\nASSESSMENT: 1. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, moderate control. 2. Tinea pedis.\nPLAN: Medication refills were given for Glucotrol 5 mg dispensed No. 120 with two refills, two p.o. q.a.m, two p.o. q.p.m, Glucophage 500 mg No. 90 one p.o. q.a.m, two p.o. q.p.m, and Avandia 2 mg No. 30 with two refills one p.o. q.a.m, and a new prescription for Lotrimin AF 1% cream dispensed 12 g with one refill, apply to the affected area b.i.d. for up to four weeks.\n\nXian, Imogene 64187177 07\/30\/72 Page 2\nThe patient has an appointment scheduled with her primary care provider Dr. Paul Shaw for 8\/16\/72, and was advised to keep that appointment.\n\nGrace Vann, N.P.\nGV:arreola:06:278:08;37-60093.doc;DD:07\/30\/72;DT:08\/01\/72;DV:07\/30\/72;\n\n\n* Record date: 2073-05-29\nInternal Medicine 97 Weld St Xian, Imogene Grandview, NE 13472 81376761 (552) 598-5590 05\/29\/73\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Xian is 75 years of age. She has adult-onset diabetes, which in the past has required treatment with insulin. She has been managed with oral hypoglycemics because of her reticence to using injections. She also has a history of CVA.\nI last saw her in August of last year. She was seen by Ms. Vann, our nurse practitioner in early May.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Glipizide 5 mg two in the morning and two in the evening, Plavix 75 mg one p.o. q.d, and Avandia 2 mg one p.o. q.a.m. According to Ms. Vann's note of Apr 29, 2073, she is also supposed to be taking metformin 500 mg one in the morning and two with the evening meal as was prescribed back in 2072. The patient and her son today are not sure that she is taking this medication. In fact, they believe that she is not. There has been moderate polyuria and polydipsia. Control of diabetes has been erratic. Hemoglobin A1c has been elevated. On Apr 29, 2073, blood glucose was 274, BUN was 25, creatinine 1.0, electrolytes within normal limits as was calcium. Cholesterol was 315. Hemoglobin A1c 10.6. The patient has not experienced chest pain, palpitations but she is moderately short of breath when climbing stairs. There has been no orthopnea and no PND. She denies dysuria and urgency and has not experienced near syncope. She denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination today, she appears well. Blood pressure 122\/66. The heart rate is 90 and regular, weight 113 pounds, approximately five pounds less than last year. Random blood glucose was 224.\nThe patient suffered a minor CVA back in September 2071. She denies any recurrence of motor deficits or symptoms suggestive of TIA. The patient has a past history of hyperthyroidism that was treated with iodine 131. She has not been hypothyroid since then. In fact, the last TSH level was 0.05 in August of last year, just prior to her departure to Ghana. She denies heat intolerance as well as palpitations.\nOn physical examination, she is a small lady in no acute distress. The neck veins are flat. The extraocular movements are full. There are no symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The chest is clear to auscultation. The heart sounds are regular. There are no rubs or gallops. The lower extremities are free of edema and now her toes are free of fungi but the nails are overgrown and require attention.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A 76 year old woman with a past history of hyperthyroidism, which was treated with I-131 with good results who, last year before she left the country, had a subnormal TSH. She does not have obvious symptoms of hyperthyroidism but today I have obtained a repeat TSH as well as T3 and T4.\nDiabetes continues to be a problem. Glycemic control continues to be difficult to achieve. Today, I have reinstated metformin at 500 mg p.o. q.d. The son is going to check on the medications to make certain that indeed she is not taking this medicine at this point. The other medications were continued. It is indeed possible that she will need insulin in the near future. I plan close followup and will see her again in six weeks' time. If she is hyperthyroid, this may also explain the difficulty in achieving glycemic control. Against this is the high cholesterol. She used to be on Lipitor, which was discontinued during her trip to Ghana. I have reinstated the Lipitor today 20 mg p.o. q.d. I have also added a small dose of enalapril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. to protect her kidneys even though she is not hypertensive.\nKevin Shamar-Trevino, M.D.\neScription document:0-389401 NFFocus\nDD: 05\/29\/73 DT: 05\/30\/73 DV: 05\/29\/73\n\n* Record date: 2080-06-15\nWalk-in visit because of Pt of Dr Shamar Seen in the EW bo HA, work up negative.

She was seen with a very complete evaluation\nby Ida Oquinn for her recurrent urinary tract infections. She submitted a\nurine sample initially that appeared fairly clean but then after straight cathing her\nurine Ida was able to obtain cloudy foul smelling urine. A fair amount retained\nas postvoid residual. Ms. Hendrickson completed her 14 days of Levaquin with\nresolution of her symptoms but now over the past few days she has noticed an odor\nand cloudiness to her urine again without fevers of dysuria or urinary urgency. She\nhas anxiety associated with the possible reasons why she should have recurrent\ninfections. She is most concerned about having cancer. She is scheduled to see Dr.\nQuezada March 24th. The patient reports increased anxiety of late as there have\nbeen issues going around the housing projects. A 14-year-old girl was raped and\none week later an individual was climbing a tree to try to get into her apartment.\nShe ended up combating him with a broom and he ran away. She did not file a\npolice report. As a result of this she has had more problems with her anxiety. She\nreports compliance with all her medications except that she ran out of her Lasix\napproximately one week ago. She had been taking 20 mg one-half to one tablet\nsporadically but not on a regular basis. She denies any chest pressure or\npalpitations. She denies any shortness of breath. She denies any problems with\npain in her right foot or increased swelling of her left ankle.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: Blood pressure is 156\/90. Heart is regular rate and rhythm.\nNo murmurs, gallops or rubs. UA reveals positive nitrate and 2+ leukocytes. Her\nankle reveals trace edema on the left. Her right extremity is warm to palpation.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\n(1) Hypertension. Blood pressure has been high over the past two visits. This\nmay be due to the fact that she has not been taking her Lasix. I have\nrestarted her on the Lasix 20 mg to take one-half tablet q.d. on a regular\nbasis.\n\n(2) Anxiety. I will write a letter for her to the Rupert Housing Council to try\nto get her moved out of this current housing project to a safer environment.\n\n(3) Recurrent urinary tract infections. She had a urine culture submitted today.\nShe was given another prescription for Levaquin 150 mg one PO q.d. She\nwill stay on this until her appointment with Dr. Quezada. I attempted to\nreassure her that it is unlikely that cancer is the cause for her current\nrecurrent infections. It is more likely due to her cystocele.\n\n(4) Peripheral vascular disease. This appears stable. She remains off the\ncigarettes.\n\n(5) ASCVD. She remains without symptoms.\n\n(6) GERD. She remains on the Prilosec.\n\n(7) Hyperlipidemia. She remains on Lipitor. She should have a repeat\ncholesterol obtained with a new primary care physician in the fall.\n\n(8) Borderline high sugar.

In 7\/77, he had been treated at NAMG for a left lower lobe PNA with levofloxacin, and developed diarrhea while in the hospital. After discharge, he continued to have profuse diarrhea, and was treated with IV hydration and metronidazole C. diff infection, first found to be positive on 7\/31\/77. Since then he has had multiple episodes of recurrent C. diff. Most recently, he was admitted to NAMG for treatment of recurrent C. diff in 1\/77, with improvement after receiving inpatient vancomycin and flagyl, and discharged to NAMG, where he was for 3 weeks. He received 21 days of flagyl. After about two weeks, he noticed a gradual increase in his stool frequency. Three weeks prior to admission, he began taking 500 mg PO Flagyl q8h, which he had at home. He felt that his symptoms were improved somewhat on the flagyl. One week ago, he saw his PCP, where a C. diff stool toxin was negative. At that point, he stopped the PO flagyl, and shortly afterward his diarrhea again progressively worsened. Currently he is having 10 BM per day, and he states that they are similar to odor, color, and frequency to his prior C. diff episodes. He has also had a few days of lower abdominal pain, 2-3\/10, with no clear pattern, and noticed a few flecks of blood in his stool 2 days ago on one occasion. He denies other symptoms including fever\/chills, n\/v, cp, sob, and dizziness. He reports that when he had taken PO vancomycin in the past, it cost $40 per tablet.\nED: Afebrile, HR 70s.

He has been disabled but has managed to stand and get himself in and out of the wheelchair. He began noticing cramps and tingling of both his upper extremities and they felt the same as before he had his cervical laminectomy in 2081. He was unable to grip his cup and began dropping objects. Nerve conduction studies were done in September 2094 the conclusion is that he has bilateral evidence of cervical polyradiculopathy right greater than the left. evidence of sensory poly neuropathy there is also evidence to suggest a mild mean neuropathy at the wrists bilaterally\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n1.

CAD S\/P CABG X3 in 2087 catheterization done in March 2090. Recent stress done in May 2094\nHistory of CABG, known hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, dyspnea on exertion, cancer, smoking. S\/P B\/L CEA, Cath '90 - occluded SVG to Cx, patent LIMA. patent SVG to RCA. Admitted with (L) sided chest pain, ruled out for MI by enzymes. Ruled out for aortic dissection by CT. Last Adeno-MIBI 3\/2092 - posterior wall MI, Negative for ischemia. PURPOSE(S): Diagnosis of ischemia. DIAGNOSES: Primary diagnosis is chestpain. Additional diagnoses include hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia. MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, ECASA, Furosemide, Lopressor, Losartan. PROCEDURE: The patient underwent an adenosine stress test with exercise. Maximum adenosine dose: 140 ucg\/kg\/min. Supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec). 1 lb hand held weight 1097MBq 99mTc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired. Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day. Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made. STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150\/60 => 150\/60 (MINIMUM = 130\/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed. Chest pain did not occur. REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities. Sinus bradycardia 56\/min. First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test. Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia. However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited. SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size. There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study. Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia. The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--LVEF=50%.\n\n5.

His last surgery was in 2092 ORIF left Tibia IV sedation with spinal anesthesia no complication noted in anesthesai record. There has been difficulty placing the IV ( pt said this happens a lot). According to note from 3\/07\/81 anesthesia for previous cervical Laminectomy Rapid sequence induction MAC #3 8.0 ETT easy intubation. Pt was a smoker for 50 years occasionally uses Albuterol with a spacer suggested he use it pre op. He had a stress test done in May 2094 and it was negative for ischemia and a LVEF was 50%. Report in this note under Medical Problems. He was admitted for chest pain in May 2094 and he no longer is using the NTG sl or the Nitropace. He was told the pains he feels is most likely from his CABG ( CABG X3)- Grafts to RCA patent,occluded at circumflex, LIMA patent and the post sternal pain. The stress test was done during this admission as well as a CAT scan to r\/o aortic dissection. ( also negative) his biggest problem seems to be his not very well controlled diabetes. There is a note from the May 2094 admission that he was to receive a trial of Nexium to see if his chest pain was epigastric but pt and wife said he never received this medication. He denies any GERD or chest pain since may 2094. He recognizes his hypoglycemia sx's and also his hyper glycemia sx's ( blurred vision) when his blood sugar is 480.

EXAMINATION DATE: 12\/12\/95. Comparison films: The prior films are available for comparison to due PACS technical difficulties. Comparison is made with the report of prior C-spine CT from January 2095. History:72 year old man with history of paraplegia from traumatic injury in 2066 with new sensation loss and motor loss below T8. Technique:Sagittal T2 images were obtained of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine. The Axial T2 images are obtained from T10 through L1. The images are moderately motion degraded in the thoracic and lumbar spine. The cervical spine MRI was repeated three times due to motion. No contrast was used. Findings: CERVICAL SPINE: Straightening of the cervical lordosis is noted from C2 through C6. Bone marrow signal demonstrates patchy areas of T2 high signal within the C4 and C5 vertebral body. Posterior disc osteophyte complexes are present at C2\/C3, C3\/C4, C4\/C5, C5\/C6, C6\/C7. The patient is status post posterior laminectomy and fusion which causes susceptibility artifact. The laminectomy from C3 through C7, previously noted, is not well visualized due to motion artifact and susceptibility. THORACIC SPINE: There is partial fusion of T4 to T5 with loss of height of T4 and focal kyphosis at this area. Myelomalacia is noted from T1 through T5. There is focal T2 high signal within the cord substance at the T4 level. T2 low signal collections are noted posterior to the cord at T6 through T12. A high signal septation is present through this collection at T7 and extending from T11 through L1. This low T2 signal collection displaces the cord anteriorly from T7 through T10. The cord is small from T7 through T10 consistent with myelomalacia and high T2 signal. High signal is also present in the cord substance of the distal thoracic cord and at the conus. Small amount of T2 high signal is noted in encircling the distal thoracic cord and the spinal roots. LUMBAR SPINE: Straightening of the lumbar spine is noted with grade 1 retrolisthesis of L4 on L5. There is a levoscoliosis with apex at L4\/L5. Disc demonstrates T2 shortening within several lumbar discs and disc height loss at L4\/L5, L5\/S1. T2 high signal at the endplates are noted around the L4\/L5 and L5\/S1 disc levels. Moderate to severe stenosis of the bilateral neural foramen at L5\/S1 facet osteoarthritis and disc height loss of L5\/S1 is noted. The patient has had prior surgery of the spinous processes of L4 and L5. The conus terminates at L1\/L2. The spinal roots appear clumped centrally and there is T2 high signal around the upper spinal roots. T2 high signal is noted at the distal aspect of the thecal sac. IMPRESSION: 1. Low T2 signal collections from T6 through L1 with displacement of the thoracic cord anteriorly from T7 through T10. The differential diagnosis for this collection includes unusual flow artifact or multiloculated septations or epidural collections. Recommend dedicated thoracic and lumbar spine MRI with contrast and T2 axials through the L spine and C spine. If clinically indicated, consider repeat C spine MRI with contrast. Dr. Winters was informed of this at 2:15 PM on 12\/12\/95. 2. Myelomalacia of the thoracic cord from T4-T5 level and at T7-10. 3. The spinal roots are incompletely imaged but have a clumped in appearance suggesting arachnoiditis. Repeat axial images through the entire spinal roots could better evaluate this. 4. Degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine at L4\/L5 and L5\/S1. degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine at C3\/C4 C4\/C5 C5\/C6. 5. Prior surgical fusion of the cervical spine and laminectomies are incompletely evaluated on the study due to motion. Please see prior CT report for the details. 6. Mild focal kyphosis with height loss at T4 appears subacute and may be from prior trauma.\nMRI (12\/13): MRI THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM History: History of previous cord compression. Status post recent aorto-bifemoral bypass. Now with sudden onset of loss of lower extremity motor function and sensation. Comparison: MRI spine dated 12\/12\/95. Procedure: Multiplanar MR imaging of the entire spine was performed without and with Gadolinium. Findings: There is an old compression fracture at T5. There is exaggeration of the normal kyphosis at this level. There is no evidence of marrow edema to suggest acute fracture in the spine. There is straightening of the normal lumbar lordosis. There is grade 1 retrolisthesis of L4 on L5. There is degenerative change in the L4-5 and L5-S1 end plates. There is increased T2 signal in the L4-5 and L5-S1 discs however the adjacent endplates are well preserved, and although infection cannot be completely excluded, it is considered very unlikely. There is a small central disc protrusion at T8-9. There is no evidence of significant canal stenosis in the thoracic or lumbar spine. Examination of the cord demonstrates myelomalacia extending from the T5 level inferiorly. There is prominent flow artifact in the CSF surrounding the myelomalacic cord. The conus is expanded and demonstrates hyperintensity on T2 weighted sequences. There is no associated enhancement. No vascular flow voids are identified. There is a small right pleural effusion. There is consolidation at the right lung base. This may represent atelectasis or infiltrate and correlation with chest x-ray is recommended. IMPRESSION: Expansion and signal abnormality in the conus superimposed on chronic myelomalacia. The differential diagnosis includes cord infarction, and demyelinating disease. Vascular malformation and neoplasm are considered less likely due to the absence of vascular flow voids and abnormal enhancement.\nMRA: MRA of the aorta with runoff was conducted as per departmental protocol. FINDINGS: Due to the nature of MRI imaging, dedicated sequences were performed to evaluate the vasculature. The remainder of the abdominal organs are not fully evaluated and if clinically indicated, directed sequences could be performed. This was a technically limited study due to suboptimal contrast bolus and movement. The patient was agitated and unable to cooperate. No evidence for an aortic dissection is identified. There is moderate stenosis of the left subclavian artery just beyond its origin. The celiac trunk is patent. There is mild\/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. The renal arteries cannot be assessed on this study. IMPRESSION: 1. Limited study due to technical factors and patient movement however no evidence of an aortic dissection is identified. A repeat MRI with better contrast bolus and sedation may be obtained if clinically indicated. 2. Moderate stenosis is noted just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. 3. Mild\/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the SMA.\nCT Spine (12\/13): report pending Assessment\/Plan: 74 y\/o vasculopath presenting with new neurological deficits, abdominal pain, UGI bleed, progressive renal failure, initially worrisome for aortic dissection.

She states that her pain started about three weeks ago when she was bending and picking up a pot. She states she had a pain in her back that radiated around her right side down her groin into her medial leg, not past the knee. She states that it went away at that time. The next day she felt worsened and had difficulty working and saw her physician. An MRI was ordered. Since then, she feels about 60-75 percent better. She states that her pain is constant and describes it as a sharp pain. She does state she feels weak and her knee would buckle. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She states she uses a walker to get to her bathroom, however, otherwise stays in the recliner. Her symptoms are increased with lying down and standing and decreased with sitting.\n\nTherapeutically, she has not received any physical therapy or occupational therapy. She is currently taking Darvocet, however, less frequently, and Celebrex for arthritis. Diagnostically, she has had an MRI scan in April 2092 that showed multi-level spinal stenosis, most prominent at L3\/L4, especially on the right side, secondary to facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum infolding, as well as possibly a mild disk bulge. Her mammogram was done in 2091 which was okay. She has not had a bone mineral density at this time.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Currently, the medication she is on is Celebrex, Hyzaar for her blood pressure, and Darvocet for her pain.\nALLERGIES: She states that taking Tylenol With Codeine gives her toes a burning sensation, and ibuprofen causes tinnitus.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has got high blood pressure and shoulder arthritis.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She had a left breast biopsy which she states was not cancerous.\n\nSOCIAL\/FUNCTIONAL HISTORY: She is functionally currently not working. She is taking sick time. She has not worked for the past three weeks. She is a Head Nurse and worked at The Library Corporation for the last 35 years. She states her job is medium as far as intensity of work. Functionally, her activities of daily living are limited, and she uses an assistive device.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and she has four healthy children, ages 51, 50, 48, and 46. She does not smoke or drink.\nFAMILY HISTORY: She has aunts with diabetes and brother that had an myocardial infarction at 59.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, no fevers, chills, recent infections, bladder, thyroid problems, rash, shortness of breath, palpations, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bowel or bladder or sexual problems or urination difficulty. She does have some joint pain and swelling in her shoulders and her feet occasionally. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She does have some trouble walking secondary to the pain. She does not feel fatigued and her appetite is okay and she does not feel anxious or stressed. She does have some mild trouble with sleeping, however, this has improved over the last few days.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, well-developed, well-nourished, well-groomed, normal mood and affect, but slightly anxious with movement, female in no acute distress at this time. On musculoskeletal examination of lumbar spine, flexion was within normal limits. Extension she had her type of pain at about 10-20 degrees. Side-bending was unremarkable. On hip examination she had some decreased internal rotation on the right when compared to the left. Straight leg raise bilaterally was negative, however, supine, slight guarding on the right. Femoral stretch was positive on the right but not on the left. On neurological examination, as far as motor examination, there is some slight decrease, half a grade, quadriceps and hip flexors; however, this was functional; otherwise unremarkable on the right or the left. Her reflexes were 2 plus in the achilles. Babinskis were downgoing, 1 plus at the patella on the right, and 2 plus on the left. Sensory examination slightly decreased at L3 on the right; however, normal throughout; otherwise, gait was antalgic on the right and she did not want to bear weight.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Right L3 acute radiculopathy secondary to herniated disk and facet arthropathy.\n2. Functional limitations secondary to pain, causing her functional weakness.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Transforaminal epidural steroid injection at L3 and L4 on the right.\n2. Physical therapy after her injection.\n3. Continue her medications of Darvocet and Celebrex. 4. Keep her out of work until she is able to receive the injection, as well as continue with her physical therapy to improve her strength, given her acute radiculopathy.\nThe patient was seen and examined with Dr. Xayasane, who agrees with the plan above.\n\n\n\nEdward Xayasane, M.D.\ncc: David Utterback, M.D.\nDD:05\/06\/2092\nDT:05\/09\/2092\nTL:95468 :423\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2097-06-03\nTime of visit: 6\/03\/2097, 1330 hours Time of note: 1630 hours\nPatient seen and examined with the team. Note of Dr. Ellis reviewed, findings confirmed. Available electronic notes reviewed, X-rays reviewed, labs reviewed.\n73 y. o. woman who has worked as a nurse at TLC for 40 years. Nonsmoker. History of hypertension treated with Hyzaar. Current illness began 5-6 months ago with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion that has progressed to the point that she has to stop to catch her breath after walking up only 4-5 steps in a stairwell. She finds it difficult to get started on her work because of fatigue. She has had a cough that initially produced yellowish, slimy sputum, but more recently has been dry. She notes occasional wheezing. She also noted muscle and joint pain involving the shoulders and lower extremities over the past 5-6 months that she attributed to arthritis. No polyuria, but has noted nocturia X2 for the past 5-6 months. During the same period of time, has noted very dry mouth. No abdominal pain, but some difficulty with constipation for the past two weeks.\nAppetite diminished and she lost about 30 pounds. She noted a nodule on the extensor surface of the left elbow that her PCP cut into recently. She has also noted a nodule on the dorsal surface of the right foot that seems to get larger.\nShe experienced substernal chest pain with radiation to the back that lasted several hours, prompting her to come to the ER. No associated diaphoresis, nausea. Pain somewhat better with sitting up.\nOf note, she has known of having a cardiac murmur for many years.\nExam: Pleasant black woman in no distress. BP 158\/79, Pulse 80, regular; O2 sat 98% on room air. Afebrile. Skin darkly pigmented nodule left elbow extensor surface, similar nodule right dorsal foot just proximal to 4th\/5th toe. No other rashes. HEENT: pale conjunctivae, anicteric. No nasal findings, no facial skin findings (specifically, no lupus pernio). Dry mucous membranes. Neck: small, soft, mobile 0.5 cm node left anterior cervical chain. Chest: inspiratory crackles at both bases. Cardiac: No JVD. Regular rhythm. III\/VI (I do not feel a thrill) harsh nearly holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium, but especially prominent at the RUSB with radiation to the clavicles, neck. Also heard at the apex and radiates to the left mid-back (?same murmur). The murmur intensifies when she stands. No gallops. No rub. Abdomen soft and nontender. No spleen tip. Liver edge not palpable. Lymph nodes: fullness below the left axilla, although not confident of discrete nodes.\nData: There is considerable testing available to us from her recent visits to the Walk-In Clinic and to Dr. Utter.\nA CXR from 5\/2097 shows bilateral hilar adenopathy, mediastinal adenopathy, and interstitial infiltrates.\nCreatinine 1.7\nDate\/Time CA ALB 06\/03\/2097 12.3 (H) 3.4 06\/02\/2097 12.8 (H) 3.5 05\/28\/2097 11.8 (H) 3.5\nDate\/Time ALT\/SGPT AST\/SGOT ALKP TBILI 06\/03\/2097 41 (H) 41 (H) 67 0.7\nDate\/Time NT-BNP CK CK-MB CKMBRI 06\/03\/2097 135 9.6 (H) 06\/03\/2097 126 8.6 (H) 6.8 (H) E 06\/02\/2097 4285 (H)[1] 06\/02\/2097 NEGATIVE\nDate\/Time TROP-I TROP-T 06\/03\/2097 0.12 (H) 06\/03\/2097 0.12 (H) 06\/02\/2097 NEGATIVE 06\/02\/2097 NEGATIVE\nDate\/Time FE TIBC FER 05\/28\/2097 33 237 130 Date\/Time WBC RBC HGB HCT 06\/03\/2097 6.4 3.98 (L) 10.2 (L) 30.4 (L)\nDate\/Time MCV MCH MCHC PLT 06\/03\/2097 76 (L) 25.5 (L) 33.5 198\nDate\/Time DIFFR METHOD %NEUT %LYMPH 06\/03\/2097 RECEIVED Auto 71 (H) 20 (L)\nDate\/Time %MONO %EOS %BASO 06\/03\/2097 6 3 0\nDate\/Time RETIC 06\/03\/2097 1.7\nSerum angiotensin converting enzyme 68 (7-46 U\/L) LDH 354\nEKG: ST elevations V1-3.\nProblems:\n1. Dyspnea on exertion, progressive. 2. Interstitial lung disease. 3. Bilateral hilar adenopathy 4. Weight loss 5. Symptomatic hypercalcemia Nocturia Arthralgias Constipation Fatigue 6. Prominent systolic murmur(s?). Changes with maneuvers suggest this may be secondary to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. There was evidence to suggest this on an echo from 2085, but obviously, need more recent data. 7. Minimally elevated troponins. Uncertain significance. 8. Anemia, mildly microcytic. 9. Elevated LDH. 10. Renal insufficiency, likely secondary to uncontrolled hypercalcemia. 11. History of hypertension.\nDiscussion:\nSarcoidosis, until proven otherwise. She is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis, but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission. The lung findings, systemic symptoms, hypercalcemia, anemia, abnormal serum ACE level are all suggestive of this diagnosis.\nHer hypercalcemia is symptomatic and should be treated with volume repletion. She should not receive diuretics at present. Long term treatment will be dependent on the underlying diagnosis and its treatment. I think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and I expect this will improve the hypercalcemia, but we need definitive diagnosis first.\nThe cardiac murmur is impressive, but likely unrelated to the pulmonary disease. We need echocardiogram to better define valvular function. The minimally elevated troponins are not felt to be of clinical significance at this point. Appreciate Cardiology input on this finding.\nSuggest:\n1. Stop HCTZ,avoid diuretics until fully volume repleted. 2. IV normal saline. May need rates in the 150-200 range to control her hypercalcemia acutely, but she has had this for some time, so can be conservative with fluids approach. 3. Agree with check PTH, vitamin D levels. 4. Follow lytes, creatinine, calcium, Hct. 5. Agree with check echocardiogram. 6. We should ask the Pulmonary Service to see her in consultation. Bronchoscopy with biopsy may be the best way to obtain confirmatory tissue for diagnosis of sarcoidosis.\n\n\nEdmond I. Utterback, M.D. Pager #57863 Internal Medicine B Attending\n\n* Record date: 2097-06-29 Internal Medicine B Intern Admission Note\nPATIENT: GOLDY WILHELM MRN: 9543443 ADMIT DATE: June 29, 2097 ATTENDING: Dr. William Xian PCP: Dr. Casey Frey (new) CONTACT: Leo Wilhelm, son 705-690-8475 CODE: Full\nSource: Patient, family, chart ID\/CC: no appetite, acute renal failure\nHPI: 73 yo black woman with h\/o HTN and recurrent non-malignant axillary lymphadenopathy, newly diagnosed with HOCM in the setting of fatigue, weight loss and hypercalcemia concerning for sarcoidosis during a work-up at her last admission to MEDIQUIK on 6\/2-6\/20\/97. At that time, the patient noted that 3-4 mo PTA she had experienced worsening fatigue and dry mouth, as well as poor oral intake with associated 30 lb weight loss.\nIn early May, she presented to the walk-in clinic with these complaints and a CXR showed increased interstitial markings and mediastinal lymphadenopathy subsequently confirmed by CT. A PET CT showed FDG avidity in multiple enlarged thoracic and axillary nodes. The patient was seen at the lymphoma center by Dr. Utter, and concern was raised for multiple processes including sarcoid, lupus-like syndromes, Castleman's, and indolent lymphoma. Labs drawn at different times in recent past were notable for a Ca of 11.8 with Alb of 3.5, a mild tranaminitis in the 40s, LDH of 354, ACE of 68, normal TSH, HCT of 30.2, ESR of 85, SPEP with diffuse gamma globulin increase, positive ANA at 1:2560 with nuclear pore staining (highly specific for biliary cirrhosis), elevated B2MG at 17.5, and elevated kappa and lambda free light chains at 66 and 83.5, respectively and negative HIV. The patient s hypercalcemia was treated with IVF, lasix at times, and a dose of bisphosphonate, which led to a decrease in Ca to 10.1.\nAxillary lymph node biopsy 6\/08\/97 revealed non-specific follicular hyperplasia, though to be consistent with a reactive process. Oncology was consulted, and a lymphoma work-up was pursued; flow cytometry revealed polyclonal CD19+ B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with no evidence for a monoclonal B or unusual T cell population. Repeat CT examination of the chest revealed no change in the bilateral axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy and offered no further clues to diagnostic possibilities. The patient underwent pulmonary function testing, which showed a reduction in the FEV1, FVC, and FEV1\/FVC ratio; total lung capacity and subdivisions were normal, resistance and specific conductance were normal, and single breath diffusion capacity was reduced. On 7\/19\/97, a bronchoscopy was attempted, but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure, and it was not performed. Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended that the patient be evaluated in the outpatient setting for biopsy under general anesthesia. Fungal antibodies were sent, and a trial of steroids was not attempted during hospitalization. Since discharge, the pt reports that she continues to feel very fatigued, and has not felt like eating. She reports significant acid reflux, saying only water goes down and a lack of appetite with very dry mouth. She notes continued weight loss of 15lbs since leaving the hospital, tolerating little more than 1-2 cans of Ensure\/day per her family. She further denies N\/V, diarrhea, fever\/chills\/dizziness or recent infection. Of note, she has been drinking little, but urinating 9-10 times a day, clear urine with large volumes. She has not had a bowel movement for several days. She has continued her medications as instructed at the time of discharge.\nIn addition, her family notes a dramatic change in her mood and activity level since prior to hospitalization. She used to be very active, working nearly every day and keeping up her household. She now spends most of her day in bed sleeping, relying on her children for help and awakening early in the AM unintentionally. She has felt too tired to pursue her usual nightly bingo game. She denies suicidal ideation, saying she has her four grandchildren to liver for. ED COURSE: At the ED, the patient was afebrile, HR 59, BP 136\/61, RR 16, O2 Sat 95%. She was given IVF and labs were drawn.\nPMH\/PSH: HOCM LAD HTN Uterine prolapse Urge incontinence Rectocele Bladder prolapse\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Multivitamins (Mvi) 1 TAB PO QD Acetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin) 325 MG PO QD Atorvastatin (Lipitor) 40 MG PO QD Sennosides (Senna Tablets) 2 TAB PO BID prn [constipation] Docusate Sodium (Colace) 100 MG PO TID prn [constipation] Metoprolol Tartrate (Lopressor) 100 MG PO Q6H Omeprazole (Prilosec) 40 MG PO QD Verapamil Hcl 60 MG PO Q8H Nifedipine (Sustained Release) 30 MG PO QD\nALLERGIES: NKDA\nSH: No EtOH, tob, drugs.

She had an IVC filter placed and was started on anticoagulation and discharged again to Harton Center on 12\/1 and now presents with nausea, vomiting, and several days of poor PO intake. This is actually her fifth admission to MEDIQUIK this year &#8211; first in June when she was diagnosed with HOCM and then in July when she was started on empiric steroids for sarcoidosis. She says her appetite has never returned to normal since her surgery (although her July admission note also documented malaise and poor appetite) and that she has had some mild nausea on a daily basis since her surgery. The nausea and her fatigue became worse four or five days prior to admission and since then she has been vomiting many times a day. The nausea is not related to meals and she has not noted any blood in the emesis. She has had poor intake as a result of the nausea and has only had broth over the last few days. She denies fevers, chills, headaches, cough, abdominal pain, or change in the character of her colostomy output.\nED COURSE: On arrival to the ED, vitals were as follows: 98, 164\/84, 84, 24, 98%\/RA. Her abdomen was non-tender and minimally distended. CT of the abdomen was concerning for a distal small bowel obstruction although no focal transition point was identified. She was seen by surgery and an NGT was placed. She was given 2L of IVF and morphine 2mg IV x2.\nROS As above, otherwise reports baseline blurry vision (has been told of cataracts in the past).

Also abdominal exam remains benign at this time.\nAppreciate surgery input NGT to low wall suction NPO except meds for bowel rest Serial abdominal exams Check colostomy output guaiac Acute renal failure: Her creatinine was up from a baseline of 1.0 to 2.1 on admission. With IVF hydration in the ED it has already started to come down to 1.8 so it was likely pre-renal in the setting of poor intake and vomiting.\nContinue IVF while NPO Will trend Cr and pursue further ARF work-up if not down on AM labs Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in low 30s, last 32.6 prior to discharge on 11\/30. She does not appear to have an active source of bleeding and her bilirubin is within normal limits so she is unlikely to be hemolyzing. She likely either has iron-deficiency anemia (although she has been taking iron supplements) or anemia of chronic disease &#8211; or a combination thereof. Her RDW is only mildly elevated which likely indicates inappropriately low hematopoiesis.\nTransfuse 1U PRBCs Check colostomy guaiac Check iron studies, reticulocyte count Elevated INR\/hypercoagulability: She is baseline hypercoagulable with lupus anticoagulant and has had the recent large DVT\/PE s\/p IVC filter placement.

Of note, pt had recent admission to MEDIQUIK (6\/29-7\/05) at which time she presented with similar complaints of fatigue\/lethargy and routine CBC demonstrated an elevated WBC (15) and low Hct (23). She was ultimately found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia and intra-abdominal abscess that grew out E. coli. She underwent IR drainage of the abdominal collection and completed a course of Vanc\/CTX. Outpatient f\/u abd CT (7\/18) showed near complete resolution of the intra-abdominal collection. Since that time, however, pt&#8217;s sons report increasing lethargy at her nursing facility. Patient has no complaints.

Failure to thrive \/ lethargy: The etiology of this pt&#8217;s lethargy is unclear. It is notable, however, that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in July at which time she was found to be bacteremic with an additional intra-abdominal bacterial collection. At present, there is no clear source of infection, although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI. Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection, but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile. In addition to bacteremia, UTI and re-accumulation of an intra-abdominal collection, other possible causes of her lethargy include toxic\/metabolic causes (such as uremia), anemia, or depression.\n- F\/u blood, urine, and respiratory cultures\n- Will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis (If we were to start abx, would\nrecommend vanc\/cefepime given micro history)\n- Culture if spikes\n- Consider repeat abd imaging if pt continues to have a leukocytosis and doesn&#8217;t clinically\nimprove\n\n2. Anemia &#8211; Source of anemia has been unclear in the past. During last admission, pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy.

Gout. This has been present for 7 years. Evaluated at Mary by Dr. Farrar. Treated with Colchicine. He cut down the amount of organ meats and red meat that he had been eating at the time. He has not had any alcohol for 11 years. Strong family history in his father and all his brothers. Continues to have 4 or 5 relatively mild flares a year which are frequently attributable to forgetting to take the Colchicine. PMH: Tonsillectomy. Cervical radiculitis. He is a recovering alcoholic. No alcohol for 11 years. Hypertension when he was drinking. Hidradenitis. Meds: Colchicine 0.6 mg q.d. ALL: None. FH: Father died at 57 from an MI. Mother at 60 in her sleep. Brothers have gout, one has hypertension. SH: Married for the second time. His wife is Emily Ippolito another patient of mine. They will have been married for one year in May. He works as a Patternmaker for McCall in Enid. He averages 1 1\/2 packs of cigarettes a day for the last 35 years. No alcohol. No drugs or HIV exposure. ROS: Bifocals. Slightly decreased hearing in the left ear. No chest pain. Has a chronic AM cough bringing up 1\/4 cup of phlegm daily. He occasionally plays tennis and bicycles. He believes his cholesterol was 170. Does like high cholesterol food but has cut back because his wife has a problem. He uses seat belts. On physical examination he is a very pleasant large white male. His weight is 222 lbs, blood pressure 128\/88, heart rate 72. HEENT - EOMI, PERL, fundi negative. Cerumen impacted against the TM's. Benign oral cavity examination. No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. Lungs clear. No murmurs or gallops. No hepatosplenomegaly. No testicular masses or hernias. Normal prostate, guaiac negative stool. Absent distal pulses. 2+ femoral pulses without any bruits. 1+ reflexes. No swelling or tenderness over the first MTP's. Neurologic exam shows hearing decreased to watch tick bilaterally. Air conduction is greater than bone. Weber is not lateralized. Impressions and plans: 1. Gout. It sounds like this is really not much of a problem when he remembers to take the Colchicine. I encouraged him to make this a regular habit. We will check a random uric acid level. 2. Cardiac risk factors. He is a male with a very positive family history who is a smoker. He has significant cardiac risk factors. We spent a long time talking about smoking today. At his request I gave him a prescription for Nicoderm patches. He will start at 21 mg for six weeks and then move to 14 mg for 2 weeks and 7 mg for 2 weeks. We will check a cholesterol and he should be less than 200 given his risk factors. I pointed out to him his evidence by history of chronic bronchitis and of peripheral vascular disease. I think he found this sobering. 3. General health. We discussed exercise, cholesterol and seat belts. We also discussed the use of Q-Tips which I think may also be a significant contributing factor to his decreased hearing and the impaction of cerumen. I recommended ear drops. We can have him tested formally when he becomes interested in intervention. Xzavior C.

Unfortunately, he arrived 24 hours late. He is gradually recovering from a recent flare of his COPD. This started with an upper respiratory infection. He called over the weekend and was started on prednisone. He continued to have a stuttering course over the course of that following week and came to urgent care the following weekend. There he was treated with nebulizers. He reports that today he was finally able to blow 350 on his peak flow meter. He is still bringing up lots of junk. His gout has been quiescent. Medications: Albuterol. Azmacort. Colchicine. Enalapril. Allergies: None. Social History: Married. His adoption of a 10-year-old girl named Xiao has been finalized. He is employed as a sales representative and that requires a lot of lifting and carrying. He quit smoking three and a half years ago. He drinks no alcohol. Physical Examination: Looks well. His weight is 222 pounds. His blood pressure is 124\/82. Pulse 76. HEENT: EOMI. No scleral icterus. No lymphadenopathy. His lungs are completely clear posteriorly and anteriorly. Distant heart sounds without any audible murmurs. Benign abdomen without any hepatomegaly. No rectal masses. Normal prostate. Guaiac negative stool. No pedal edema. Oxygen saturation on room air is 97 percent. Peak flow is 320. Impression: 1. COPD. We discussed this at length. I think the crucial component to his treatment will be to anticipate when he is going to have a flare and responding quickly in a preventative fashion. We will have him check his peak flows at the same time every day. When he is feeling well his peak flows are always in the 350 range and he reports that they never go to 300. When it hits 300 he should call me or if it is the weekend, he should start immediately on prednisone 40 mg a day. 2. Gout. Doing well on colchicine. 3. Hypertension. Well controlled. I will check a creatinine. 4. General health. We will check a cholesterol. His cholesterols have been good in the past but he has a slightly low HDL.

When he\nreturns home from work he cooks dinner and this\ncombined with his work schedule and picking up his\ndaughter from school and walking the dog has prohibited\nhim from a regular exercise program. Needless to say,\nhe has remained active. He is not limited in these\nactivities by his respiratory function with the\nexception of some periodic exacerbation of dyspnea with\nheavy lifting. He uses albuterol during these\ninstances anywhere between 0 and 2 to 3 times per day.\nHis usual peak expiratory flow rate is roughly 300-350\nliters per minute. He knows that when his PEFR falls\nto below 250 for 3 days in a row to contact you for\nadvice as well as burst of prednisone and he has had 1\nburst of prednisone since our last visit in April.\n\nHis medical regimen is notable for Flovent 220\nmicrograms per puffs, 2 puffs twice a day, Serevent MDI\n2 puffs twice a day, Allopurinol, colchicine, Vasotec\nand the albuterol as mentioned above.\n\nRE: Lloyd Gregg -2- November 29,2083\nMR#65772757\n\nThe patient's review of systems is notable for the absence of\nfevers, chills, sweats, chest discomfort, symptoms of GERD,\nchange in his bowel or bladder habits or weight. He does\ncontinue to have nearly continuous post nasal drip which leads to\nfrequent clearing of his throat and occasional cough. There is\nno hemoptysis or significant sputum production.\n\nOn physical exam, he appears well, is in no respiratory distress.\nNC\/AT, PERRL, EOMI, AS, pink conjunctiva. TM's are clear with\nnormal light reflexes bilaterally. His nasal mucosa is notable\nfor mild erythema bilaterally with a clear nasal discharge. No\nsignificant LAN in the cervical or supraclavicular axillary\nchains. Chest exam reveals an increased AP diameter and\nprolongation of his expiratory phase. He has an occasional\nexpiratory wheeze. There are no focal findings of consolidation\nand air movement is moderate. No significant JVD and he has a\nregular rate and rhythm with an S4, S1, a normally split S2 and\nthere are no murmurs, rubs or S3. Abdomen is benign without HSM,\nfocal tenderness or masses. His extremities are without\nclubbing, cyanosis or edema. His weight is 223 pounds.\nTemperature 97.1 degrees, pulse 86 per minute, BP 142\/82 and his\nrespiratory rate is 20 with a room air resting oxygen saturation\nof 97 percent.\n\nMy impression is that the patient's severe airflow obstruction\nsecondary to emphysema is stable on his current medical regimen.\nI once again encouraged him to continue to lead robust and active\nlife. We agreed that the current action plan for a burst of\nprednisone is appropriate and I also have provided him my contact\ninformation in the event that he cannot reach you in the midst of\na flare. I have refilled all of his current prescriptions. To\ntry and prevent him from requiring these frequent bursts of\nprednisone through the winter months, we have also begun\nCombivent 2 puffs 4 times a day as well as Nasonex nasal spray to\nbe used 2 puffs in each nostril once a day. We talked about\nvaccinations and he reported that he has recently received the\ninfluenza vaccine and he has previously received the pneumonia\nvaccine.\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in Mr. Gregg's care.\nHe will follow up with us on a routine basis in 6 month's time\nbut will contact us sooner should he develop more symptoms of a\nflare of his COPD.\nRE: Lloyd Gregg -3- November 29, 2083\nMR#65772757\n\nWith best regards,\n\n\nThomas Iyer, M.D.\n\/felder\n\n\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2084-08-25\n61 yo man with CAD and PVD referred by Dr. Short for pre-operative evaluation prior to vascular surgery.\n\nHe has a long hx of ischemic ulcer of the second toe of the right foot. He was admitted to the vascular service on 8\/09 and had an arteriogram that showed complete occlusion of the SFA with reconstitution of the popliteal and single vessel run off. His pre-operative EKG raised the possibility of old ASMI although it was unchanged for a number of years. He underwent dobutamine MIBI which showed a moderate area of severe ischemia in the LAD territory. His LV was normal with EF of 59%. He underwent cath which showed complete occlusion of the LAD with collaterals from a fairly large diagonal that also had a tight stenosis. There were lower grade occlusions in the RCA territory and the LCX. He had been asymptomatic. The LAD lesion was long and totalled and not felt to be amenable to angioplasty. There were no indications to have him undergo CABG so the decision was made to PTCA the diagonal lesion to improve flow to the anterior wall. He tolerated this well. Returns today feeling well and has been active painting his fence and going up and down stairs without any chest pains or unusual SOB. Has had a hematoma in the groin.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Serevent. Flovent. Enalapril. Colchicine. Alopurinol.\nAlbuterol. Viagra.\n\nALLERGIES: None.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Father died at 57 after his 8th MI. He had his\nfirst one at age 48. Mother had a stroke in her early 50s. His brother, Shields,\ndied a miserable death with recurrent, inoperable laryngeal cancer.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Married. Continues to work as a sales representative. He\nhas an adopted child, Xiao who is now 14 and doing very well in school. Quit smoking and drinking a number of years ago.\n\n\nROS: No chest pains. Chronic shortness of breath. No bowel problems. No bladder problems. Does not exercise. Last cholesterol was 175\/42. The rest of the review of systems was negative.\n\nPE: General: Looks well.\n================ Vital signs ================\nBlood Pressure: 150\/80 142\/80 130\/78\nPulse: 84 [Regular, Radial]\nWeight: 222 [Pounds]\nSkin: Chronic ischemic ulcer on the medial aspect of his second toe of the right foot.\nHEENT: EOMI.

Ulcer as above.\n\nEKG done in the office shows NSR at 74. Axis 90. Normal intervals. He has Q's in V1-V2 c\/w possible OASMI. He has low volts in the precordial leads c\/w chronic pulmonary disease. No changes from previous.\n\n================ Problems ================\nPRE-OP EVALUATION He has rest ischemia of the toe. He has three vessel coronary disease that is asymptomatic. There are no indications at this time to push for CABG. He underwent angioplasty to try to improve flow to the anterior wall. His EKG suggests OASMI but his ventriculogram is normal without evidence of MI and EF of 59%. There are studies showing increased risk of in-stent thrombosis, MI, death in patients who have had Plavix stopped for non-cardiac surgery within two weeks of stent. He will be beyond the two week period and Dr. Short is willing to operate on him while continuing Plavix and aspirin. I believe he is an acceptable risk for surgery.\n\nPVD Will need surgery for ischemic ulcer.\n\nCOPD Doing well and is stable. Instructed to use his inhalers faithfully in the preop period.\n\nGOUT No flares this year.\n\nHYPERTENSION Better when rechecked. He gets nervous with the initial measurements.\n\nIMPOTENCE Discussed the fact that, now that he has documented CAD, there is increased risk with Viagra use. He understands that but indicates that he feels that for him personally the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n\n\n\nWelch, Xzavior Charles, M.D.\n\ncc: Dr. Farris Short\nVascular Surgery\n\n\n* Record date: 2086-07-11\nYearly visit 63 yo man with PVD and COPD.\n\nIf he has to walk a long distance gets an aching pain in the left calf.

Chronic renal failure. He has been on dialysis for the past four years. He is currently dialyzed two times per week. He apparently had been three times per week in the past.\n2. Hyperlipidemia. Fasting lipid analysis one year ago showed total cholesterol 225, triglycerides 265, LDL 161, and HDL 40. He has not been treated.\n3. Hyperparathyroidism. PTH level one year ago was 143. He is on calcium replacement.\n4. IgG monoclonal gammopathy. This was noted on immunoelectrophoresis. It was at very low levels.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg q.d, Nephrocaps one q.d, and PhosLo 2001 mg t.i.d. by his report.\n\nREVIEW OF SYMPTOMS: He states he was told he was hypertensive at last dialysis. No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.\n\nALLERGIES: No known allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient appears well. Blood pressure on multiple measurements range from 150-160\/78-82, weight 144 pounds, and heart rate 72 and regular. Chest: Clear to percussion and auscultation. Cardiovascular exam: No extra sounds or murmurs. Abdominal exam: No masses, tenderness, or organomegaly. Extremities: No edema. Skin: No rash. Musculoskeletal exam: Grossly intact.\n\nASSESSMENT\/PLAN:\n1. Chronic renal failure. The patient will continue on dialysis. I have requested screening blood tests.\n2. Hyperlipidemia. This needs to be treated. I have asked him to return for reestablishment of baseline.\n3. Hyperparathyroidism. Secondary to chronic renal failure. He is on calcium replacement.\n4. Low-grade IgG monoclonal gammopathy. Will recheck values and follow.\n5. Hypertension. A degrees systolic hypertension warrants therapy. He is due for dialysis tomorrow, however. I gave him a prescription for atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.\n6. Adult health maintenance. I gave him a prescription for aspirin, which he should be taking and asked him to return in two weeks for a full annual review.\nI instructed him to show renal staff the prescriptions tomorrow at dialysis.\n\n\n\nXavier T Mccoy, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:4-4113812 EMS\n\n\n\nDD: 03\/16\/95\nDT: 03\/16\/95\nDV: 03\/16\/95\n\n* Record date: 2095-09-19\n\n\n\n\nKEKELA INPATIENT DIALYSIS ADMIT NOTE\n\n\nNAME: Marsh, Carl\nMRN: 99579205\n\nPrimary Care MD: Xavier T.

The patient was in his otherwise good state of health when he went to his normal dialysis session yesterday. The session was uneventful, and he finished dialysis around 7:30 pm. Around 9 pm, he started noting un-controlable jerky movements of his jaw, arms, and legs. He was unable to stand by himself, and had difficulty with any motor activity. It was so bad that he was unable to feed himself, and needed help from his wife to do so. The jerking continued throughout the night without getting better, and his daughter called his PCP's office today, at which time he was instructed to proceed to the KEKELA ED. He has had a similar episode like this before in January of 2092, when he developed the exact same jerking movements after a long three day weekend when he went without dialysis (see note in LMR by neurology consultant). It was deemed at that time that his myoclonus was due to electrolyte disarray, and he was admitted to EDUCARE-FARGO and received dialysis the same day with complete resolution of symptoms. He has been symptom-free since that time.\n\nHe reports no other new events. He denies any new medications.\n\nPast Medical History:\n\n1.) ESRD secondary to hypertension\nn on HD since November 2090\nn current access is left radiocephalic fistula placed in April of 2091\nn currently followed by Dr. Tierney at the Sanford Memorial Hospital\n2.)

PMH: Her past medical history includes atrial fibrillation, status post renal allograft, status post aortic and mitral valve replacements with a mechanical valve, on chronic Coumadin, a recent aortic aneurysm repair and complications around that, including a cellulitis which has been treated, and now waxing and waning mental status. She also is insulin-dependent diabetic. MEDICATIONS: Her medications currently include: 1. Neurontin 300 t.i.d. 2. Insulin NPH 20 units in the morning, 10 in the evening. 3. Fosamax each day. 4. Premarin and Provera. 5. Tums Extra-Strength. 6. digoxin 0.25 and 0125. 7. Mevacor 40 a day. 8. Coumadin 1mg each day, except Sunday 2mg. 9. Imuran 100mg a day. 10. prednisone 20mg every other day. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient notes that she has been feeling well and more active. She is able to walk around her house without her walker. She does use the walker outside of the house for safety and precaution. She is independent in bathing and washing, as well as cooking and preparing meals. She, however, is requiring a lot of assistance with managing her medications. She has her daughter-in-law downstairs help her with this. She has not been out of the house much in the last several months, and, while she wants to drive, no-one has allowed her to get behind the wheel. The patient otherwise feels well with no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no change in her bowel or bladder. HABITS: She has had a weight which has been stable, and her appetite has been good. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for a well-appearing female who walks with a walker, slowly, but in no acute distress. Her weight is 104 lbs. Her blood pressure today is 130\/72. Her pulse is 80 and regular today. She has no peripheral edema, and she is comfortable sitting in a chair. IMPRESSION: My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is stable with her current regimen and medications. We have been manipulating her GRANITE COUNTY MEMORIAL Arthritis Department 32 Weld St Bird, Terri Lisbon, SD 52797 80910690 659-5187 1-20-66 Page 2 Coumadin to keep her INR between 2 and 3.5 and, most recently, it was 2.5, earlier this week. She will continue on her current medications, as noted above. The bulk of the discussion was regarding her home situation and her mental status. She has clearly improved her mental status gradually over the last several months. She is anxious to drive. However, everyone in the family who is with her at the visit and her visiting nurse agree that she is not mentally sound enough to be behind a wheel. I explained this in no uncertain terms, and also set a milestone in management of her own medications. Hence, our three goals that we set today were: 1. Management of the patient's own medications, which she was doing six months ago. 2. To get out of the house at least once a week, using either community transportation or a family member. 3. To be doing the family's laundry each week. While the patient was not happy about being told that she could not drive, she understood the reasons and was satisfied with the goals that we set. Hence, I will see her back in about six weeks and see how she is doing with these goals. As well, we will continue to have the visiting nurse see her every other week to monitor her blood sugar and Coumadin.

She is a 70-year-old female with multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation, status post renal allograft, status post MVR and AVR, on Coumadin now, history of CABG in the setting of her valve replacements, history of a recent aortic aneurysm repair with some mental status diminution after the surgery. MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Hydralazine, Lopressor, prednisone, Coumadin, Provera, NPH insulin, Neurontin 300mg t.i.d, Imuran 100mg a day, Zocor 20mg a day, and Digoxin 0.25 alternating with 0.125mg. She is also taking Fosamax 10mg a day and Premarin 0.3mg a day. The patient is followed closely by a visiting nurse at home. Her blood pressure checks have all been 120-140\/70-90 and her blood sugars have been running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from 150 all the way up to 450. We have made some adjustments recently in her NPH morning dose, and hope to see if this will make a benefit. Patient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has been able to fill her cassettes for her medicines, and overall manage her medicines without problems. She does note that she is having some pain down her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica. The patient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and wanes over time. The Neurontin in the past has been very helpful for this. The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, has had no fevers or weight loss recently, and has no dyspnea at nighttime. PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a short female in no acute distress, who walks with a walker today. Blood pressure: 144\/76. Pulse: 78 and regular. Her lungs bilaterally are clear to auscultation. Her heart is with sharp click during S1 and S2. She has got a regular rate and rhythm today. Her abdomen is soft, nontender, with no organomegaly. She has got a well-healed abdominal scar. She has got no lower extremity edema. Her musculoskeletal examination is notable for tenderness up into the sciatic notch on the left side. She has got otherwise joints that move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth. There is no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere. Today will check a hemoglobin A1C, a CBC, and a chem 7 for routine monitoring. My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well. I will not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C. I suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it remits on it's own. GRANITE COUNTY MEMORIAL Arthritis Department 12 Weld St BIRD, TERRI Lisbon, SD 52797 80910690 3-03-66 PAGE 2 Lastly, as far as her ability to drive, this has been an issue for the last several months since her abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. She is clearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by her being able to manage her own medications. I have discussed this issue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable with her trying to drive with someone in the car with her. I will talk to her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or his wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard without any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then finally in a more regular situation. We will try this over time and see how it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as letting her drive on her own.

As you are well aware, she is 71-year-old female who resides currently at the Elm Hills Nursing Home where you have been taking care of her. I have not seen her now for the past ten months. For my records, I am going to summarize her medical history briefly. It includes a history of atrial fibrillation. She is status post an MVR with Duluth Clinic. She is on chronic anti-coagulation. She is status post a renal allograft for what is believed to be a history of strep glomerular nephritis. She has been on Imuran and Prednisone for several decades with no history of rejection. She also has a history of a CABG in the setting of her valve replacement. As well, she has a history of spinal stenosis, for which she has been treated intermittently with epidural steroid injection. About a year ago, she had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and in this setting developed some delirium and at that point was sent to rehab where she had a ankle fracture and a long recovery and she spent time at several different nursing homes and had a hip fracture as well as a recurrent ankle fracture and most recently has been with you at Elm Hills Nursing Home. I also have a discharge summary from a recent hospitalization where she had a pneumonia, a right middle lobe which was successfully treated with levofloxacin. MEDICATIONS: Her current medications from the notes that I received include Premarin .3mg, Neurontin 300mg each day, Miacalcin nasal spray, Provera 2.5mg, Synthroid 25mcg, Digoxin 125mcg, Cardizem CD 180mg a day, Imuran 100mg a day, Lopressor 50mg twice a day, calcium carbonate 500mg three times a day, Isordil 3 times a day as well as Coumadin based on her INR. ALLERGIES: She has an allergy to penicillin as well as sulfur and cephalosporins and of note she had been on a tapering Prednisone dose which seems to have been stopped. As well, she is on sliding scale insulin and Humulin N, which seems to have been adjusted recently. RE: Bird, Terri MRN: 80910690 January 13, 2067 Page 2 The patient was brought to me today by her family, because they were concerned that she was not getting optimal care. In talking to her, she says she feels quite well. She has no pain. She has no pain in her buttocks or her legs. She says her breathing feels well. She has no productive cough. She has no chest pain. She denies any peripheral edema. She notes that she is concerned that she is not getting enough exercise at Elm Hill Nursing Home, but otherwise feels like she is getting reasonable care. However, she does breakdown and cry about her current situation in that she is depressed about living in a nursing home. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On the exam today, her blood pressure is 122\/70. She has a regular rate and rhythm on heart exam with a pulse of 72. She has sharp clicks over her chest. She has a soft abdomen with no organomegaly and a well healed scar. She has equal pulses bilaterally. She has got a normal skin exam with multiple skin tags. She has a full range of motion in her upper extremities as well as her hips, knees and ankles. She has a stooped gate and I watch her walk with her walker and she seems relatively stable. She is somewhat confused about the date and the place, but recognizes me and is able to articulate very clearly about her current situation at Elm Hills. I have no laboratory data to speak of. I had a long conversation with her and her husband as well as her son and daughter-in-law and explained my concerns with her overall safety and I thought that currently it would be unwise for her to be in an unsupervised setting. I thought that a nursing home is a reasonable place for her to be and suggested quite strongly to consider an antidepressant. It looks like you have had a psychiatrist evaluate her recently and I think it would be worthwhile, at least a month trial of SSRI, gradually titrating up the dose based on her side effects. I am more than happy to see her intermittently to give her reassurance, but it seems like your care has been excellent and feel free to contact me with questions about her past history.

I last saw her on 07\/27\/2112. She is a 72-year-old woman who is status post a right MCA distribution cortical infarct in April of 2112 with residual left hand weakness. Since I last saw her Mrs. Lindsay has not done very well. She has had multiple recent falls and her gait has become even more unsteady. She tends to veer to either side and does have a frequent feeling of lightheadedness. She has hit her head on a couple of occasions with these falls.\nOf note her blood pressure medication has been essentially doubled since I last saw her. She is now taking 10 mg of Zestril every day instead of five and taking Atenolol 50 mg q.d. instead of 25 mg p.o. q.d. She does have intermittent weakness of the left hand which is likely recrudescent of her prior stroke symptoms and not new strokes. She does not have discoordination, vertigo or diplopia. She does have intermittent chest pains as well which she loath to bring to the attention of her physician. She is reluctant to use a cane because her family states that her husband does not use a cane and he is older, why should she have to use a cane. She has been switched to Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. from aspirin. This was done without my knowledge as well. She continues to have difficulty feeling my feet and this has been a chronic problem for her as well. On examination she is alert. She is a garrulous and tangential historian and needs to be frequently refocussed. Her speech is fluent in English. English is her second language and she is less fluent in that language. Her visual fields are full to confrontation. Her extraocular movements are full with no nystagmus. Her face is symmetric other than a mild left nasolabial fold flattening. She has a mild left pronator drift and slowed finger tapping on the left side. She has no ataxia on finger-to-nose-to-finger testing. Her gait is slightly wide-based and unsteady. She can veer to either side and frequently has to hold on to someone next to her for stability. IMPRESSION: I do not feel that Mrs. Lindsay has had a new embolic event, however I am quite concerned about her continued falling and difficulty with both her continued peripheral neuropathy and likely hypoperfusion. This appears to be pressure dependent and I would suggest that we back off on her antihypertensive medications at this time. In looking at her recent CBCs she has also been consistently anemic and with her complaints of chronic fatigue I think this could certainly be a factor. Atenolol could certainly be a factor in this as well and perhaps a different antihypertensive medication could be considered or it could be discontinued altogether. Furthermore with her recurrent chest pains she should seek an opinion from her primary care physician regarding this and I have counseled her to do so. I will see Mrs. Lindsay in follow up in 6 months time but I am available to discuss her care at any time in the interim. Sincerely, Hudsen Parsons, M.D. DD:03\/08\/2113 DT:03\/11\/2113 TL:7407 :3768\n\n* Record date: 2115-10-08\n\n\nEducare-Fargo A MSIII Admission Note\nPt: Lindsay, Anastasha\nMR#: 5563788\nDate of Admission: 10\/07\/15\nAttending:\n\nSource: Pt, Pt's daughter and husband, chart.\n\nCC: Dizziness, unsteady gait, difficulty speaking per family\n\nHPI: 74 yo F with pmh of DM, CRI, Breast Ca, CVA, who is s\/p cataract surgery on 09\/25\/15 presents with two days of unsteady gait, weakness, mild dysarthria and hallucinations.\n\nShe has a baseline amount of increasing forgetfulness, decreased appetite, and increased somnolence over the past 2 years. She frequently forgets whether or not she has taken her medications. She rarely leaves her home as her walking is limited by joint pain and shortness of breath. She moves around the house infrequently and when she does it is usually from the bed to the couch per her daughter. She has had several falls in the recent years. She does not cook and is overall much less active than her husband who lives with her. At her baseline, her family is concerned that she has been developing Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nTwelve days ago, she underwent cataract surgery on her R eye and was in her usual state of health for several days thereafter. However, two days ago, she started to hallucinate mentioning she was seeing flies, birds and spots. Her family noted that she had difficulty forming words and also spoke incoherently at times. She also complained of dizziness, had an increasingly unsteady gait, and did not want to eat both expressing no interest in food and saying she was worried about not being able to swallow. She has also been falling asleep very rapidly recently, so much so that she has fallen asleep on her plate at the breakfast table. However, she has also woken up frequently at night, often talking incoherently and once even getting up and attempting to cook breakfast at 3am. Her family also mentions that her face had recently become swollen. Her family reports that her symptoms were worsened after she took her Diamox, and thus they stopped giving it to her.\n\nShe was brought to the ED on 10\/06\/15 as her family was concerned that she had another CVA. Her VS on admission were BP 120\/41, HR 54, RR 18, T 96.4, O2 sat 96% on RA. She had a negative CT, MRI, CXR and labs were drawn. In the ED she reportedly had an episode of choking while eating a pancake. Currently, she reports that she is seeing many small black dots, is tired and has no dizziness, HA or pain.\n\nROS: Notable on ROS is progressive dysphagia over the last year that she reports has gotten much worse of late. She also reports occasional transient stabbing pain in the center of her sternum that often accompanies intense emotions and is not made worse by activity. She has occasional palpitations.\nShe reports no recent fever, wt loss, cough, hemoptosis, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, sick contacts. She reports some urinary incontinence.\n\nPMH:\nBreast Ca- Diagnosed in 10\/2111, she is s\/p R lumpectomy and XRT for her tumor that was HER-2\/neu 2+. She is followed by Dr. Ursula Marshall at SDP.\nDM- Controlled by insulin. Her most recent HbA1c was 6.0 in June 2115.\nCVA- 3 yrs ago, had abrupt onset of L hemiparesis that resoloved within 48 hrs.

She has dementia at baseline and has recently had the addition of Diamox, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, to her medications. This could have had the effect of decreasing her intravascular volume, thus leading to a prerenal state and her increased uremia, and decreased renal clearance of her renally cleared medications, thus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia.\n\nCommon causes of delirium include FEN disturbances, infections, drug toxicity, metabolic disorders, low perfusion states, withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives, and idiopathic. In addition, there is the possibility of CVA, however the MRI and CT were negative and the time course and symptoms are not consistent with a CVA. Of concern though is that she has somewhat atypical signs of delirium such as dysarthria and ataxia.\n\nMetabolic causes of delirium commonly include Na, Ca, Mg, B12, NH3 imbalances. Her Na, Mg and Ca are wnl. Her BUN is elevated at 77, which is close to twice her baseline, and in the setting of a fragile patient, this could be enough to tip her over to delirium. Her glucose was 215 on admission, which is elevated, but only mildly so for a diabetic and not at high enough levels for MS changes to occur.\n\nInfection is possible as her WBC is slightly elevated at 12.1 with 78% poly's. However, there is no obvious source of infection and she has a normal CXR and U\/A, likely ruling out a PNA and UTI respectively. She has no signs of infection at the site of her eye surgery. She could have a bacteremia secondary to other infection or due to her procedure, but without a fever, this is highly unlikely.\n\nHer mental status change could be drug induced, as she is on multiple medications with the recent addition of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye drops as well as Diamox that was recently stopped by the family. Eye drops generally do not get particularly high systemic absorption, although there is an anatomic proximity to the CNS. However, cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, and corticosteroids are all known to induce delirium and she is on all of them, including two SSRI's. The new Diamox could be enough to tip her over as it is a diuretic and by itself it can cause confusion, and by inducing more diuresis, it can cause a prerenal state, thus decreasing renal clearance of her other drugs and increasing their levels, thus leading to delirium. Indeed, her baseline Creatinine is from 1.6-1.9 and was 2.4 on admission to the ED and her baseline BUN is from 20-40 while it was 82 on admission to the ED.\n\nThere is no present concern for drug toxicity and her tox screen was negative. There was no seizure activity noted and her symptoms have gone on too long to be a post-ictal state\n\nHer BP on admission was 115\/51 and her pulse was 62, which does not point to a low perfusion state as a cause. She had a recent stress test that was negative. However, it is possible that she has some orthostasis, which would fit with her recent history of falls at home. However, this would not cause the delirium.\n\nHer dementia has been developing over a few years and the possible etiologies include Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, pseudodementia, thyroid abnormalities, B12 and\/or Folate deficiency, tertiary syphilis and chronic infarct dementia. Chronic infarct dementia is a distinct possibility with MRI of brain showing chronic infarcts in the right posterior frontal and left parietal regions. Her stasis, DM and high homocysteine levels (18.8 in 2113) are risk factors with PFO for multi-infarct dementia.\n\nPlan:\n1. Delirium:\n500 cc bolus of NS, followed by maintenance IVF of 1\/2NS at 80cc\/hr.\nTSH, B12, Folate, RPR, ESR.\nD\/C her HCTZ, Avapro, Atenolol and recheck her lytes in the AM.\nCall PROMPTCARE in AM for consult re the d\/c of Diamox.\nSeroquel 12.5 mg overnight.\n\n2. Renal failure:\nlikely pre-renal given FeNa<2% and response to fluids in ED\ncontinue gentle hydration\nD\/C HCTZ, Diamox as likely precipitants of delerium and renal failure\n\n3. ID: Cont to monitor for signs\/sx of infection. None currently present.\n\n4. GI: Elevated Pancreatic Enzymes:\nNo signs or symptoms currently. Cont to follow.\nElevated AST and AlkPhos: Consider ordering a GGT.\nDysphagia: consider a barium swallow.\n\n5. FEN: Speech and Swallow consult. Soft diet.\n\n6. Proph: Nexium, Heparin. PT\/OT\n\n\n\nGary Aragon\nx23368\n\nIntern addendum:\nPt seen and examined with Gary Aragon, agree with assessment and plan. In brief, 74F with dementia presenting with acute on chronic renal failure and delerium. Etiology likely multifactorial, however, diamox is the only new medication and may explain both her worsening renal failure and delirium. Will pursue broad differential as outlined above.\n\nUlysses Xiao\n\n\n* Record date: 2120-03-09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeurology Resident ER Consult Note\n\nPatient Name: Lindsay, Anastasha\n\nMRN: 5563788\n\nDate\/Time\/Place of Exam\/Initial Assessment: 3\/06\/2120 3:50 p.m.\nTime paged:3:38 p.m.\nTine Called Back: 3:42 p.m.\nTime Reccs given: 4:30 p.m.\n\nConsulted by: ED for L. facial droop, dysarthria; English speaking, interviewed with translator\n\nHPI: Ms. Lindsay is 76y.o.

His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test. He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.\n\nHis stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia. He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test. Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities. Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.\n\nHe had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring rarely, but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol. The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week. He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different. He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.\n\nHe denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.\n\nPast medical history:\nDMII, CAD, s\/p CABG, VF Arrest Hypercholesterolemia, 1st Degree AV block, RBBB, NSVT\n\nMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\nDalmane 30 mg\nglyburide 2.5mg po qd\nLipitor 20 mg\nlisinopril 5 mg po qd\nmetformin hydrochloride 500 mg\nNexium 40mg po qd\n\nPhysical examination:\n-BP: 110\/70\n-Pulse: 50\n-General: No acute distress.\n-Skin: No rashes, anicteric.\n-Heent: Unremarkable\n-Neck: Carotids 2+ without bruits.

Swallowing is fine with fewer choking episodes when he drinks water, but no problem with the ingestion of other substances.\n\nNo cough, phlegm, lower extremity edema, chest pain or chest infections.\n\nNo reflux symptoms.\n\nSneezing spells and coryza, especially in the morning, have been most noticeable in the past several months.\n\nHe enjoyed his trip to Romania, and had only two days when he had a couple of minor spells.\n\nMedications: Advair, 100\/50, one puff b.i.d. (continues the 10 second breath hold); lisinopril; atenolol; Mestinon; Metformin; no proton pump inhibitor.\n\nOn examination, he is his usual fit-appearing self. Blood pressure is 130\/70, respiratory rate 18 and unlabored, heart rate 55 and regular. Conjunctivae are clear. Sinuses nontender. Nasal passages are narrowed but without inflammation. Oropharynx: Mild crowding in the posterior pharynx, but there were no definite exudates. No goiter or adenopathy. Back: Normal configuration. Chest: Normal percussion note, faint prolongation of the expiratory phase without definite wheezes. Cardiac: Vague cardiac impulse, 1\/6 systolic mid to late systolic murmur at the apex, JVP 8 cm with borderline HJR, no S3. Abdomen: Soft, scaphoid, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass. Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. Skin: Well tanned.\n\nPulmonary function tests today show regression of the FEV1 from 2.09 liters on 6\/27 to 1.72 liters, similar to the 1.62 liter value of 6\/13, with an FVC that has decreased from 3.47 on 6\/27 to 2.8 liters now, although with an FET of only 8.5 versus 14.3.\n\nCT scan today, by my review - A tiny nodule in the extreme right apex, mildly thickened bronchi in the extreme left lower lobe, status post mediasternotomy with diffuse calcification of the coronary arteries.\n\nImpression:\n\nEpisodic dyspnea due to asthma, with underlying excellent functional status and because of his stoicism and fitness, with the variability in pulmonary function on testing correlating well with a slight increase in the frequency of his occasional episodes, because of the asthma and allergies, he may benefit from Singulair.\n\nProbable mild occult gastroesophageal reflux.\n\nIschemic coronary disease, status post VF arrest and revascularization.\n\nMyasthenia, mainly ocular.\n\nPrior Raynaud's syndrome.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nContinue Advair at the current dose.\n\nTrial of Singulair, 10 mg p.o. q. p.m.\n\nLow threshold for adding a proton-pump inhibitor and\/or intranasal steroids.\n\nContinue exercise program.\n\nReturn visit in three months with pulmonary function tests at that time.\n\nIt has been a pleasure to participate in his care.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\nDean S.

Target LDL 70.\n\nCoronary artery disease\nFollowed by Dr. Middleton. Suffered a cardiac arrest while skiing January 2072. Resuscitated, cardioverted, sent to Lowell General Hospital, transferred to SMC. Cath showed 70% distal left main; 90% proximal LAD; 90% first diagonal; 60% left circumflex; 40% first marginal; RCA normal. Underwent three-vessel bypass grafting (SVG to LAD, diagonal, OM). Has done well since then. Most recent ETT January 2076 showed an equivocal mild apical reversible defect, but nothing else. Asymptomatic. 02\/23\/2077: Remains asymptomatic.

I have not seen him since November. About three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because he was gaining weight. He does feel that his shoulders are definitely improved. It is unclear what he is actually taking, but I think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the medication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension and 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet. He is concerned because of the relatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the right. When he does this, he will note that he feels as though he is going to pass out although this has not actually happened. This only occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left. He has no visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other cranial complaints. On examination today, BP 120\/80. He has no bruits over the carotid. He has no tenderness in this region either. He has good peripheral pulses at the arms. His joint examination is much improved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint synovitis. Clinical Impression: #1: Inflammatory arthritis - possibly RA - with response noted to Hydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone. He has stopped the Prednisone, and I would not restart it yet. #2: New onset of symptoms suspicious for right-sided carotid disease. Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies. Patient advised to call me if he develops any worsening symptoms. He has been taking 1 aspirin per day prophylaxis long-term, and I stressed that he continue to do so. He will follow-up with me shortly after the ultrasound study. Xzavian G.

No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem. No variation with food. No change with position (e.g, leaning forward). Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations. No radiation to the jaw or arm.

She denied chest pain. She was attended to and her BP was 220\/117. She was given 2 SL NTG, O2, and Lasix, after which her SOB somewhat improved but her HTN continued. She also complains of a chronic cough that is productive of white\/yellow sputum.

CXR: Lungs: The lungs are satisfactorily inflated. There is increasing prominence of the interstitium and peribronchial cuffing when compared to the prior study consistent with interval development of CHF. Surgical clips are again noted projected over the left lower hemithorax. No definite focal consolidation is demonstrated. Pleura: There is no pneumothorax. The hemidiaphragms are very slightly less distinct than on the comparison study. This could be related to the onset of parenchymal changes of CHF, but could also be related to a small amount of pleural fluid. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with CHF.\n2.

Her exam and imaging is consistent with pulmonary edema, as she has had in the past. The precipitant of her flash pulmonary edema is less clear, however. She describes waking up acutely short of breath and was found to be profoundly hypertensive. It is possible that HTN 2\/2 a change in her diet or fluid intake at rehab, ischemia, increases renin-aldo, or other cause led to flash pulmonary edema. Conversely, however, CHF may have precipitated her HTN. 1. Shortness of breath\/CHF: Evidence of volume overload by exam and imaging. PE also on the differential but seems less likely given improvement of resp status, negative LENIs. -- Lasix 40mg IV now -- Strict I+O -- Daily weights -- F\/up PA\/Lat -- Continuous O2 sat monitor;Telemetry, cardiac monitor -- f\/up cardiac enzymes -- ASA 325 qd -- Will give Lopressor 25 Q8 and Captopril 50 Q8 for now but may need to reconsider the BB if CHF less compensated. -- Albuterol and atrovent for possible COPD component given tobacco history -- Consider TTE in AM -- Consider PFTs\n2. Leukocytosis: Infection vs stress response. Patient presents with elevated WBC with 80% polys. Infectious work-up has included U\/A that is negative for infection. CXR does not show evidence of focal consolidation, however may be obscured by pulmonary edema. Mental status at baseline.

Two years later she was seen by her PCP and referred to surgery. In March '72 a mammogram showed a 1.6 cm left breast mass at 12 o'clock, also evident on ultrasonography. An additional group of indeterminate microcalcifications was noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. On 3\/22\/72 a biopsy of the left breast mass confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma. Stereotactic core biopsy of the upper outer quadrant calcifications showed only fibrocystic changes. On 5\/31\/72 she underwent a L lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy. Pathology revealed a 2.0 x 2.5 x 2.3cm invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3, with negative margins, ER+PR+Her2neu-, sentinel node negative. She was then referred to multidisciplinary clinic and received a recommendation for whole breast irradiation and adjuvant endocrine therapy.\nINTERVAL HISTORY: Returns to see us for regular 6 month follow up. She had follow up chest imaging with her PCP which did not show evidence of pna. She is happy to hear this. She reports she is doing well at home. Son agrees.

Her husband visited ever three weeks or so. She is walking somewhat better with less pain but moves very slowly. She says that for the past two weeks she first had some substernal pressure which moved down into her abdomen and now instead of having one bowel movement every one or two weeks she is having a bowel movement three times a week which is formed and not bloody. She put herself on Pepto-Bismol and is gradually getting better.\nShe has not had any chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, cough or hemoptysis. She has no visual signs. She has not been seen by the ophthalmologist recently. Her hearing is good. She has mammograms yearly. She sees her gynecologist on a yearly basis, Dr. Giles, having changed from Dr. Godfrey.

She states that she takes the Avandia in the morning and she feels very weak at lunchtime such that she has to get an orange juice. She says that her blood sugar has dropped but when she checks it, it has been around 100 mg% and I explained to her that it is a normal blood sugar but it may be that the drop causes her to have symptoms.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She weighs 192 lbs stripped which is a weight gain for her. Her blood pressure is 122\/76 in the right arm sitting with a wide cuff. She appears as a well developed, pleasant white female, grossly overweight, moving slowly and can only get up on the examining table with help because of her back pain.

Calcium 1200 mg q.d.\nShe states today that her abdomen has been distended for the past 5 days. She has not had a bowel movement in 10 days. She ordinarily has a bowel movement once every 2 weeks. She takes nothing to move her bowels and she is extraordinarily upset about her daughter who is homeless. She has provided for her daughter, helped her get a job, and the daughter is emotionally ill, and I have advised the patient that she should be in a mental institution. The patient no longer care for her daughter and her daughter cares nothing about her father and mother. It is a hopeless situation and 45 minutes were spent in discussion of the daughter's illness and what the patient would do about this. I have told her to use some Dulcolax suppositories and Dulcolax by mouth for probable impacted feces, although this is not an uncommon thing for her and I have ordered a set of blood tests to check on her diabetes, kidney function, etc. She has a good physician in Maine where she is planning to move in June and she will return to me next week for a complete physical. She does have diabetic neuropathy mild and diabetic nephropathy mild. Her back has healed. She no longer uses a cane to walk except on climbing stairs. She no longer has any chest pain or shortness of breath. She is extraordinarily anxious and hopefully she will listen to the advice that I gave her.

She comes with her daughter who assists with the history. I will review her history for the record.\nShe is a 69-year-old right-handed woman who was hospitalized at the Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss. Her daughter notes that she had deteriorated over the course of a month or two. Her movements slowed down, and she became unsteady on her feet, and her memory deteriorated. This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization. During that hospitalization a head CT on 7\/25\/03 was reported unremarkable. (There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.) An MRI of the brain on 7\/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus. There was no abnormal enhancement. This was consistent with small vessel stroke. EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features. An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC. CSF ACE was normal. Cultures were negative. CSF VDRL was negative. Because she has a history of sarcoidosis, it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis. She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily. Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone, but she remains abnormal. She has lowered the prednisone to 10 mg daily now. Reviewing the laboratory studies today, I see that although an RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab. She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis. Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na (133) and Mg (1.3), normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20). CSF HSV PCR was negative. HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.\nShe has a history of asthma going back many years. According to her daughter, she had a skin lesion excised from near her left eye about two years ago. Apparently, this showed noncaseated granuloma, and that is when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was first made. She then had a mediatinoscopy on 4\/10\/02. Biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis, supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. She has type II DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, and she has had a thyroid adenoma.\nHer current medications are prednisone 10 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, troglitazone, metformin, glyburide, sisinoril, pravastatin, vitamin D, calcium CO3, Colace, and an inhaler for her asthma as needed. She is allergic to sulfa agents and to fluticasone nasal spray. There is no history of allergy to PCN.\nHer parents both died of some type of cancer. There is no family history of sarcoidosis or of neurologic disease.\nShe is a widow. She has four children. She used to work for Lowe's. She now lives with a daughter.\nShe has had no recent fever or chills. Her weight has been stable and her appetite good. There is no history of exertional chest pain or palpitations. There is no history of cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She has had no rash or joint symptoms.\nPulse 126, regular. BP 126\/66. She is obese. Ears, nose, and throat are clear. There are no cranial bruits. The neck is supple with full carotid pulses and no bruits. There are wheezes bilaterally. The heart is regular with no murmur. The abdomen is benign. The extremities are normal.\nThere is general psychomotor slowing. She is oriented to time, expect that she gets the date off by two days as Aug 31. She is oriented to place. She is inattentive. She is able to recite the months in order, but she gets lost trying to recite them in reverse. She has trouble registering 4 words, and she recalls only 2 of 4 after three minutes. There is no aphasia. She cannot copy interlocking pentagons and her copy of a 3D cube shows poor spacial representation.\nThe visual fields are full. The pupils are 3 mm and normally reactive. The fundi are poorly visualized. The eye movements are full and conjugate with no nystagmus; pursuit movement are saccadic. Facial sensation is intact. Facial power is normal and symmetric. Hearing is grossly intact. Weber and Rinne tests are normal. The palate elevates normal. Gag is present. The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius power are normal. The tongue protrudes in the midline. Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal. There is a low-amplitude, high-frequency tremor in action and rest. Temperature and pinprick sensation are diminished in the lower extremities with a distally-predominant gradient. Reflexes are normal (2\/4) and symmetric in the upper extremities and at the knees and absent at the ankles. Plantar responses are flexor. Coordination is intact. Romberg is negative. Gait and station are normal.\nHer treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July. Since syphilis, too, could cause noncaseating granulomas, and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated, this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. I will review that issue with you and with Dr, Villalpando. She had CSF pleocytosis in July. With that and the positive treponemal test (FTA), she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis. I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services. Concerning her need for prednisone, I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis. If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis, then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course, her CSF, and her syphilis serologies.\nFinally, from the MRI of 7\/28, shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus. These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes. She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke, but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis, we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this.\nI would recommend treatment now with a 14-day course of high-dose (20-24 million units a day) penicillin. She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy, then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone, to follow her clinically and with repeated LP, and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course.\nThank you for this consultation.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nKeondre Viera, M.D.\n\n\n* Record date: 2104-01-30\nNEUROLOGY RESIDENT CONSULT NOTE\n\n\nPATIENT NAME: Dalila Haynes MRN: 78361343 DATE OF CONSULT: 1\/30\/04\n\nConsulted by: ED for altered mental status and generalized weakness\n\nHPI:\n69 yo F h\/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s\/p treatment who presents with several weeks increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion. Patient is unable to give a reliable history; history from daughter Inez Haynes, whom I called on the phone, and from LMR (primarily Dr. Keondre Viera's August neurology note). Her daughter reports that current decline is similar to her presentation in July 2103.\nShe was hospitalized at Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss that had progressed over 1 to 2 months. Head CT on 7\/25\/03 with only mild ventriculomegaly. An MRI of the brain on 7\/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus. There was no abnormal enhancement. This was consistent with small vessel stroke. EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features. She had normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20). CSF HSV PCR was negative. HbA1C was elevated at 8.6. An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC. CSF ACE was normal. Cultures were negative. CSF VDRL was negative. She was initially treated with prednisone 40 mg daily tapered down to 10 mg daily. In follow up, it was noted that RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab. This was thought to represent neurosyphillis and she was admitted and treated w\/ 14 days of IV penicillin. Prednisone was subsequently tapered to off since her presentation was thought to be consistent w\/ neurosyphillis and not neurosarcoidosis.\n\nPer her daughter, patient had improved back to being independent of ADL's and walking with a cane witout assistance. Over the last few weeks, she has gotten progressively more weak with multiple falls. Has trouble standing now, seems unsteady on her feet, has been primarily in bed for the last few days, requiring assistance to get to the bathroom or she falls down. Over the last several days, she has become even more globally weak and confused. She has been talking about relatives who are not in the house, thinking that they are there; thinking that the closet is the bathroom.

Exam notable for poor memory and some confusion about recent events. Labs are unremarkable except minor electrolyte abnormalities. Head CT unremarkable. Her prior presentation was thought to be most likely due to neurosyphillis as detailed above, though there was still the possibility of neurosarcoid. She has not had a repeat LP to assess for resolution of prior abnormalities, and now that she has a recurrence of symptoms, she should have repeat LP. She should also have an MRI as a thalamic or frontal stroke is another possible etiology. This could be a more global failure to thrive in the setting of deconditioning followed by poor PO's, but this should be a diagnosis of exclusion. CXR raises a question of retrocardiac opacity suggesting possible PNA, but with normal WBC, no URI sx's or cough, and no fever, I think it is unlikely that she has PNA and will follow clinically.\n-check her gait -check ESR\n\n-LP for standard studies and save 5-10 cc for additional studies depending on cell count\/TP -MRI of the brain -EEG -further lab w\/u pending LP results -remove foley catheter -PT consult\n\nBobby S.

She is here with her daughter. She notes that she is mostly feeling tired lately. She is able to walk with help and is even unable to walk upstairs with assistance. She is here in a wheelchair and says she is kind of tired and lets her daughter gives most of the history even when asked simple questions. She has been checking her blood sugars and she shows me the results. In the morning, the sugars have been fairly low in the 57-100 range, around noontime high at 144 up to 398, and in the evening high again 176-245. She is taking Lantus 38 units at 9:00 p.m. and she is on NovoLog coverage less than 25-0 units, 125-152 units, 151-204 units, 201-256 units, 251-308 units and greater than 310 units. She would like to switch over her Lantus to the Pens since the pen is so much easier for her. She complains of hemorrhoids, although she says they are actually getting better, she had previously had four now she has two. There is no bleeding. There is no pain, kind of itchy and uncomfortable. She is in fact not having any problem with constipation at this time. She is having bowel movements every day. She is not having any chest pain, no trouble breathing, no fevers, sweats or chills. No abdominal symptoms. She notes her stomach is really fine and it just not causing any trouble at all.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Aspirin, lisinopril 40 daily, Lantus 38, NovoLog coverage, omeprazole 40 daily, metoprolol, potassium chloride, Lasix 40 daily, Pravachol 40 nightly, and Symbicort.\n\nALLERGIES: Bactrim GI intolerance, fluticasone, cough and sucralfate unknown.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She has never smoked, no alcohol, no street drugs.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well developed, well nourished, no acute distress. Blood pressure 121\/65, pulse 106, weight 169.8, and temperature 98.6. A delightful woman, English speaking and sitting in a wheelchair. Quite alert, did know the president, could not recall the vice-president or against whom the president ran in the last election. She did know the day of the week and she knew where she was. She also remembered to remind me about a prescription when both her daughter and I almost forgot. She is an absolutely delightful woman, appears well and alert despite the fact that she lets her daughter provides most of the history and responses. She appears comfortable, breathing easily, no use of accessory muscles of inspiration, speaking in full sentences, no cough, no spine or flank tenderness. Heart sounds S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop. Chest is clear to auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes, or rhonchi. She is clear to percussion. Extremities: Without edema, cyanosis or clubbing, no calf tenderness.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n1. Diabetes. Her A1c today was 6.6, which represents excellent control despite a fairly high glucoses she was recording. I therefore did not want to increase her regimen despite the high glucoses. We will continue for now. I did give her an appointment with the diabetes nurse for help in management of her diabetes.\n2. Hypertension. Her blood pressure is fine. We will continue current regimen. We will check electrolytes.\n3. Tachycardia actually improved relative to her last visit. She is asymptomatic in this regard except for some fatigue.\n4. Fatigue. This is most likely due to stepping down from the prednisone 60-40. This is what the patient and her daughter believe. She was somewhat fatigued before, but they note that it is worse with this. She does need to come off the prednisone and Dr. Villalpando who she just saw is going to try to come up with another plan for her. Check cbc.\n5. Acid associated symptoms well controlled with omeprazole.\n6. Right knee mild osteoarthritis, not a problem today.\n7. CNS syphilis status post treatment.\n8. Question of CNS sarcoid currently on 40 mg of prednisone and hopefully she will be able to come off of that and perhaps get started on something else.\n9. Cholesterol. We will recheck her cholesterol today and will check an SGPT.\n10. Thyroid nodules. Ultrasound in July 2103 showed stability.\n11. Adrenal adenoma. Her CAT scan in May 2102 showed stability and some adenopathy consistent with sarcoid.\n12. Lichen simplex chronicus. Dermatology diagnosis from 2101. Not addressed today. Hopefully, she will be stronger at her next visit and we can recheck.\n13. Osteopenia. She will continue calcium and vitamin D. I encouraged weightbearing exercise as tolerated.\n14. Glaucoma suspect, not addressed today.\n15. Small vessel ischemic disease. MRI from July showed changes consistent with small vessel ischemic stroke. She is currently on aspirin and stable.\n16. Hemorrhoids - anusolHC given. Given no bleeding and no pian, this hopefully will fuffice. Recommended avoiding constipation, as she is doing, with lots of dietary fruits and vegetables.\n\nHgA1C 6.6 CBC slightly elevated WBC likely due to prednisone SGPT, lytes o.k.

The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed. In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning. There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg. This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed. The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated. She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.\nThe second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.\nShe was seen by Neurology on 02\/10\/43 after she was admitted. The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report. Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe. Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50. There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.\nOn examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings. MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes. The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage. MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes. Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.\nCurrently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup. It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was. Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA. Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor. There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough. The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills. There are no medication allergies reported.\nPAST FAMILY\/SOCIAL HISTORY: Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, diabetes, depression, neuropathy, anxiety, COPD, arthritis, and sinus symptoms.\nMEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Lopressor, glyburide, Naprosyn, Neurontin, Paxil, Lescol, Advair, trazodone, Glucophage, and? .\nNot withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke. She uses alcohol occasionally. She has a 12th grade education. She lives alone and is a widow.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure is 148\/86, pulse 83 and regular, respirations 20. The patient is overweight. Height is 5 foot 3 inches. Weight is 217 pounds. Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm. Poor neck posture is noted. Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels. Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits. Temporal arteries are normal. Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years. Romberg is negative. Tandem gait is normal. The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia. There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left. This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic. There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.\nNEUROLOGICAL TESTING: Mental status is essentially normal to orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of information. Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive. Extraocular movements are full. Visual fields are intact. There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological. Visual fields are intact. Hearing is intact. Oropharynx is normal. Palate elevates well. Tongue is midline. Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact. Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities. There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing. Coordination testing today seemed intact.\nPrior neurologic evaluation from 02\/10\/43 is reviewed. Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten. Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12.\nIMPRESSION: Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology. Comment. I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress. I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant. Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature. In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant. It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.\nPLAN: Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent. She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure. We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily. We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox. It probably does not matter which medication she chooses; however, she should be on one or the other and not both. For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily. I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms. She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly. We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.\nRobert F Titus, MD\n\n\neScription document:0-9416184 IL\n\nDD: 04\/11\/43 DT: 04\/11\/43 DV: 04\/03\/43\n\n* Record date: 2145-07-25\n\nOlga comes in for 4 mo f\/u.

About a week ago he slipped on the driveway at home and sustained an injury to his left ankle. He was seen at Tri-City Hospital and was told he had a fracture. He was placed in an air splint and advised to be partial weight bearing, and he is using a cane. He is here for routine follow-up. Past medical history is notable for no ankle injuries previously. He has a history of diabetes and sleep apnea. He takes Prozac, Cardizem, Glucophage and Amaryl. He is also followed by Dr. Harold Nutter for an arrhythmia. He does not smoke. He drinks minimally. He is a set designer at Columbia Pictures. On examination today he has slight tenderness of the left ankle about four fingerbreadths above the malleolus. The malleolus is non-tender medially or laterally with no ligamentous tenderness either. Dorsal flexion and plantar flexion is without pain. There is no significant swelling. There are no some skin changes with some small abrasions proximally. There is no fibular tenderness proximally. No anterior pain is noted. No hindfoot, midfoot or forefoot tenderness is noted. I would like him to use a tube sock with his air cast. He is using a cane for ambulation. His x-rays do not show a notable fracture pattern today, and we will await the Radiology opinion.

Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year. He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer. In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home. He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses. He is unaware of a restless lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep. He denies a history of a night owl personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties. He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms. Mr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11\/26\/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81\/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas. In addition, loud snoring was noted. There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes. There was a predominance of light non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant slow-wave or stage REM sleep. There was also alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep evident during the initial sleep study. In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted. The patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01\/15\/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2\/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm. Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes). There was once again an increased predominance of light non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained slow wave sleep. Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt Breeze supportive head gear with nasal pillows. The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general. As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house. Of particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m, of unclear causative etiology). The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be ready for the day. If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m. The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis. MEDICATIONS: 1. Provigil 200 mg p.o. q. a.m. PRN. 2. Lithium. 3. Valproate. 4. Glucophage 850 mg t.i.d. 5. Humulin 15 units at night. 6. Folate. 7. Metoprolol. 8. Cardia. 9. Vitamin E. 10. Coated aspirin. ALLERGIES\/ADVERSE REACTIONS: The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage. He has lost 15-20 pounds over the past several years. His current weight is 195 pounds. He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise, but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time. On examination, the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 146\/88, (seated, left arm), respiratory rate 16. HEENT EXAMINATION: Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture, with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted. The patient appears awake, alert, with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact. He is presently wearing dental braces. No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated. No focal, sensory, motor or neurologic deficits are noted. No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence. The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias. No current clinical ictal manifestations are present. No acute evidence of micro-sleeps are noted. IMPRESSION: 1. Sleep stage\/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of lightened sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of alpha intrusions and alpha delta component to deeper sleep. These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage). 2. Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea. The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm). In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt Breeze supportive head gear with nasal pillows and with limited success. One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to tangled tubing at night and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above. 3. Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance: The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem. While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e. in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit. PLAN: 1. In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o. q. h.s. PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance. 2. The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency. 3. The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations. Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms). If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well. 4. In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim. 5. The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time). Once again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez. I hope this letter finds you well.

This CP was minimal, but the weakness made him pull over. He had a repeat of these symptoms day of admission. His EKG c\/w 2\/2107 showed flattened T-wave in V2 and TWI in V3 and flattened T-waves in I, aVL. His trop was negative, but MB index was elevated. Due to T-wave flattening, history and elevated index it was decided to start on heparin and ASA and take to cath lab.\n\nCath showed right dominant system with prox Cx 40%, LAD clear, RCA prox 70-80% lesion and ostial PDA 90%. During final dye injection, pt had VF arrest and 2 shocks. Pt regained puls and was in AF (new) with RVR. Pt was started on amio. Pt then began to experience discomfort in the RVR and it was decided to intervene. POBA was done to ostial PDA. A first no-eluting stent was placed in prox RCA and pt had dissection and thus 2cd stent was placed. On admission to CCU, pt still in AF with RVR (120's).

At that point, he noted increasing chest pressure and dyspnea on minimal exertion. Following a positive stress test, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization. Coronary angiography revealed severe multi vessel CAD. He had an IABP placed and underwent cardiac surgical evaluation. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed a moderate right carotid lesion with mild left carotid disease.\nHe underwent a 4 vessel CABG by Dr. Troyer. His graft anatomy includes a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and PLV and a SVG to the OM branch. He required re-exploration for bleeding. He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treated with Amiodarone. His IABP was removed a few days post operatively. He developed new anterior ST changes, and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his LV function from 66% to 19%.\nHe was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab. Coronary angiography revealed a widely patent SVG to OM, a 30% ostial lesion in the SVG to the PDA and PLV. The LIMA was patent, but there was no flow into the distal LAD. He underwent stenting of the LIMA anastomosis into the LAD with a 2.5mm x 18mm, 2.5mm x 12mm and 2.5mm x 12mm MiniVision stents.\nHis post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a Serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function. He also required sternal rewiring for sternal instability. He was followed by Dr. Hardin. His HIT assay was borderline negative. He was also found to have a factor VII deficiency, and was treated with argatroban. Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed a R posterior tibial DVT, and he was discharged on Fopndaparinux. A follow up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 31% with apical akinesis, with only mild mitral regurgitation. He was discharged to rehab on post operative day 20.\nHe was discharged from rehab on June 5th. On June 7th he was lightheaded and found to be hypotensive by the VNA. His systolic pressures were 78 to 90 mmHg, and his lisinopril was decreased and his Lasix dose was cut in half. He denies any chest discomfort, throat or arm discomfort or palpitations. He denies any PND, but has been sleeping in a hospital bed with the head elevated 45 degrees. The family updated the office earlier this morning - 2 pound weight gain and shortness of breath. His Lasix was increased to 40 mg bid. However, when seen by VNA, his room air saturation was 76%. 911 was called and he was brought to WGCC ED for evaluation.\n\nPast medical history: CM\/CAD as described, Hypertension, Type II DM x 15 yrs- with nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy, Mild renal insufficiency, PVD, Carotid disease, Factor VII Deficiency, BPH, Hearing loss, Vitamin B12 deficiency.\nPSH: CABG 5\/01\/97, Cataract OD.\n\nChanges to Allergies NKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]\nMedications (Confirmed):\naspirin 81mg po daily - took 4 this AM atenolol 25mg po bid fondaparinux 5mg sc daily glyburide 5mg po daily Lasix 40mg po bid magnesium oxide 800 mg po tid multivitamins 1 tab po daily omeprazole 20mg po daily Plavix 75mg po daily potassium chloride 10mEq po daily regular insulin sliding scale sc tid simvastatin 80mg po qpm trazodone 50mg x 1\/2 tab po at bedtime vitamin b12 1000 mcg po daily\nFamily history: F deceased with cardiomyopathy at 64; M deceased with CA at 54; 1 B at 85 with CVA; 1 S at 87 with CHF.\nSocial history: Married, 6 adult children, retired Geochemist.

She was last admitted one week ago with N\/V and treated for gastroparesis. Her diabetes has been poorly controlled with her last hemoglobin A1c over 12 in April of 2081. She has had recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting. During this past year in January, she was admitted to Missouri Baptist Hospital. She had a negative EGD, and HIDA scan showed low ejection fraction to cholecystokinase. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. She was admitted again a few weeks later to Missouri Baptist and had a gastric emptying study, which was consistent with gastroparesis. In February, she was seen in the Philadelphia State Hospital Emergency Room with nausea and vomiting and had a KUB, which showed significant stool. She presented again on 02\/11\/2081 and had an abdominal CT that showed thickening of the terminal ileum and possible thickening of the gastric and possible duodenal wall. GI was consulted and the colonoscopy done on 02\/14\/2081 was normal, but did not visualize the terminal ileum. A small-bowel follow-through on 02\/16\/2081 was normal. She was discharged on a regimen of Reglan and erythromycin. Since February, she has been seen multiple times in the outpatient clinic as well as medical walk-in. She reports being complaint with her regimen of erythromycin 250 mg four times a day and Reglan 10 mg twice a day. She was also recently started on Glucophage titrating up to 1000 mg b.i.d. as she had difficulty with multiple short per day regimen of insulin administration.\n\nShe was admitted from 5\/31-6\/2 and treated with IV Zofran and enemas. GI saw the pt and recommended increasing reglan to TID and adding colace and miralax. She also had a head CT to r\/o mass lesion causing the nausea, and this was negative. At the time of d\/c, her nausea had decreased. She states that the N\/V did not improve much since that admission, and she has not been able to eat much. She has pain throughout her abdomen. She denies f\/c, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematemesis, or melena.\n\nProblems\nDiabetes mellitus : since 2060's, poorly controlled\nHypertension\nGastroparesis : N\/V due to diabetes\nRetinopathy : due to AODM, s\/p first laser treatment 3\/81, sees Ophtho in Stanwood\nS\/P cholecystectomy\nS\/P TAH\/BSO : menopause at age 86, had some hot flashes which are slowing improving.\n\nMedications\nMetformin 1000 MG (500MG TABLET take 2) PO BID\nErythrocin ETHYL SUCCINATE SUSP (ERYTHROMYCIN) 250MG TABLET PO QID\nAsa (ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID) 325 MG (325MG TABLET take 1) PO QD\nLisinopril 40MG TABLET PO QAM\nReglan (METOCLOPRAMIDE HCL) 10 MG (10MG TABLET take 1) PO TID\nLantus (INSULIN GLARGINE) 40 U SC QHS\nAtenolol 50 mg po QD\nColace 2 tablets QHS\nMiralax 17 gm QOD\nZofran 8 mg po BID prn nausea\n\nAllergies\nPERCOCET - GI upset,\n\nSocial History\nLives alone; work- biological technician; no smoking; Etoh- none.\n\nFamily History\nBrother with DM.\n\nReview of Systems\nNo dizziness, F\/C, cough, SOB, CP, dysuria, joint pain.\n\nPhysical Exam\nBP: 162\/78 T: 98.6 P: 84 RR: 18\nGENERAL: Appears sleepy in her bed.\nSKIN: NL turgor, no abnormal lesions\nCHEST: Clear lungs, NL frame\nCOR: NL S1S2, no murmur, rubs, or gallops.\nABD: Hypoactive BS; diffuse tenderness but no guarding or rebound; no HSM.\nEXT: No edema, clubbing, or cyanosis\nNEURO: NL MS\n\nAssessment and Plan\n1.

Her GI symptoms began in December, 2080. Delayed gastric emptying by nuclear medicine study, with 9% emptying at 60 minutes and 29% emptying at 90 minutes.\n\nOriginally, she had been on oral medication and has been on insulin since 2076, initially on NPH bid and then switched to Lantus. After her admission June 2081, she was placed back on NPH from what had been lantus 40 U qhs + metformin 1000 bid. HbA1C was 12.2, 4\/2081, more recently it has been 10.2 in 7\/2081 and 10.1 on 9\/14\/2081.\n\nOn her last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately 10 days ago, gastroparesis was under good control without nausea or vomiting. Glycemic control, however, was poor, and it was clear to me that she was not properly administering a sliding scale, and this was too complex for her. Accordingly, and in response to severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c above 10, we changed her reigimen to NPH 70\/30 50Units BID.\nHer known diabetic complications include retinopathy with prior photocoagulopathy, nephropathy with microalbuminuria, neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet, and no known macrovascular disease. Gastroparesis may be the consequence of poor glycemic control or frank autonomic neuropathy, but is often multifactorial.\nShe was re-admitted to the PSH on 09\/30\/2081 after having 2 days of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. She was unable tolerate any oral hydration in the ED, and was admitted for management.\nOn ROSystems and history, she reports that she had been taking her new 70\/30 insulin, 50 units BID. Sugars had been running 200s, all the time 200s, no better or worse. Nausea per her report began suddenly on Friday evening 09\/27 and got gradually worse. Currently nausea has abated, but abdominal pain persists.\nWritten only for insulin sliding scale.

Found to be profoundly hyperglycemic on admission with BG of 526 with anion gap of 20. Rapidly closed anion gap to 10 with hydration alone. Abdominal pain can be multifactorial. I don't doubt that this is most likely hyperglycemia with associated gut dysmotility, but differential includes small bowel angina (pain is definitely out of proportion to exam and seems colicky), hepatobiliary disease. With normal anion gap, I doubt that this is ischemic disease of the gut, but small bowel angina is still a possibility.\nRecommendations:\n1) Gastroparesis may be in part due to poor glycemic control, we need to achieve better glycemic control to help with gastric motility.\na. Would not hold long acting insulin. Start NPH 30U BID, dose if NPO\nb. While NPO, have D5 running in IVF once fingerstick drops below 200, especially once NPH started. If she needs IVF at a higher rate, you might run D5NS at 50cc\/hour along with NS or NS at whatever rate is needed.\nc. Continue sliding scale insulin Q6H when NPO, QAC and QHS when eating, but change parameters to tighten coverage as follows:\ni. Fingerstick <150, 0 units; 151-200 4 units; 201-250 6 units; 251-300 8 units; 301-350 10 units, >350 12 units.\nd. Start mealtime insulin (clearly hold while NPO) of 10U regular pre-breakfast and pre-dinner. Hold if NPO or PO intake poor. She will need rapid uptitration from this point once eating.\ne. No metformin for now given GI upset.\n2) Agree with other therapies for gastroparesis as she had been on as an outpatient, including ativan, reglan, zofran PRN, zelnorm, miralax, colace.\n3) For crude r\/o of poor circulation to gut you could send a lactate level and check stool guaiac. Colonoscopy and endoscopic exams were normal earlier this year, but this does not exclude small bowel angina. Study of choice would be MR angiography or CT angiography of abdominal vessels. I do not think this is warranted at this point, but ischemic small bowel should remain on the differential.\n4) With hyperdynamic precordium and tachycardia, would check TSH, though this is almost certainly due to hypovolemia and compensatory response.\nThank you for the consult.\nWe will follow with you. Please call with any questions.\nWill staff in AM.\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Kenney, MD, PhD\nPager # 12036\n\n\n* Record date: 2083-02-26\nAttending Admission Note\nHPI: 54 year old woman with h\/o DM, HTN, and depression who is transferred to PSH from Missouri Baptist Hospital after being admitted from 2\/15-2\/20\/83 and then readmitted on 2\/22 with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has a h\/o several admisions to the hospital for abdominal pain attributed to diabetic gastroparesis. She has had an extensive GI work-up in the past including multiple abdominal CT scans, gastric emptying study, colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and small bowel follow through. All studies were negative except for the gastric emptying study. She has been treated with multiple medications, including Reglan, Ativan, Compazine, and Zelnorm without much effect. She is currently taking Neurontin and Cymbalta to treat neuropathic pain, and her PCP started her on MS Contin in December since nothing else seemed to be helping. The pt states that the MS Contin helped during the month of December, but then it did not seem to be working as well. The pt is distraught over her symptoms because the pain is severe and frequent. She has been unable to return to work for 2 years because of the pain, and she would like to be able to do so. The pain is not necessarily related to eating. Yesterday, she felt well and was able to eat. Today, she was doing fine until she had to drink the gastrografin, and then it escalated to an 8\/10. She received some IV morphine, and now it is down to 4\/10. At Missouri Baptist Hospital, her MS Contin was held, but when her BP went up, she was restarted on it. They also started clonidine BID for her uncontrolled HTN. It appears that a AFP level was drawn and was elevated at 11.1. However, it is written multiple times in the transfer materials that she had an elevated CEA level of 11.1.\nProblems Diabetes mellitus : since 2060's, poorly controlled Hypertension Gastroparesis : N\/V due to diabetes Retinopathy : due to AODM, s\/p first laser treatment 3\/81, found to have swelling of the optic discs in 8\/82 and evaluated at PCH S\/P cholecystectomy S\/P TAH\/BSO : menopause at age 46\nMedications (on transfer) Heparin 5000 u SQ BID Reglan 10 mg IV Q 6 hours Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG (25MG TABLET take 1) PO QAM, for high blood pressure Insulin 70\/30 HUMAN 70-30 U\/ML VIAL SC as directed, 25u SQ before breakfast and 15u before dinner.

Assessment and Plan 54 yo woman with DM, HTN, and depression who has had severe chronic abdominal pain x 2 years. Extensive GI w\/u has been negative except for gastric emptying study. 1. GI: Pain is responsive to morphine. Will continue MS contin and treat with IV morphine prn for breakthrough pain. Gastroparesis has been a working diagnosis since all other testing has been negative. She has other complications of DM which does put her at increased risk for autonomic dysfunction of the GI tract. Other diagnoses to consider are bowel ischemia, although colonoscopy and CT scans in the past have not shown any changes in the bowel consistent with this diagnosis. We will order CTA of the abdomen to rule this out. She did have a negative anti-endomysial Ab in 2081, but I think it would be worth checking both anti-endomysial Ab and anti-gliadin Ab to r\/u celiac sprue again. We will send both an AFP and CEA levels to f\/u on the unclear laboratory abnormality from Missouri Baptist Hospital. 2. HTN: BP is very elevated today, and this may in part be due to stopping the clonidine (which may have been given to help with GI motility). Will continue her on her 40 mg dose of Lisinopril and 25 mg of HCTZ. In addition, we will treat her with hydralazine until we can get the BP down. 3. DM: Will treat with Insulin NPH 25 u Q am, 20 u Q pm and with sliding scale regular insulin. Will monitor BS. 4. Pain management: Will continue Cymbalta and Neurontin along the the MS Contin and prn IV morphine.\n\nMildred D.

I will review his history for you. Mr. Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman who states that approximately three months ago, he had some increased swelling of his left leg. About three to four weeks ago, this became increasingly evident and the patient was evaluated at Elders Home in Brandon, Indiana. At that point, a CT scan was performed. CT scan of the abdomen revealed significant adenopathy in the retroperitoneal space with a 2.0 cm node between the IVC in aorta and a 1.5 cm node just posterior to that, also a 1.0 cm retrocrural node was seen. CT scan of the pelvis performed on the same day revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava extending to about 2.0 to 3.0 cm below the bifurcation as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side. The largest node in the inguinal area measures approximately 6.0 cm in diameter. The patient was then seen by Dr. Lopez on April 12th who noted firm edema in the left leg and referred him to me for evaluation.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\nWegener s granulomatosis initially diagnosed in 2083.

Positive bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly is palpable. Extremities: 2+ edema on the right and 3+ on the left, pitting. Lymph node exam: No anterior or posterior auricular, no anterior or posterior cervical, no submandibular, submental, infraclavicular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. The patient has a 1.0 cm lymph node deep in the right axilla. No epitrochlear lymphadenopathy. Inguinal region: A 4.0 to 5.0 cm left inguinal lymph node mass is palpated. Neurologic exam: Cranial nerves II through XII intact to specific examination. Strength 5-\/5, bilateral grip, bicep, triceps, deltoids, knee flexion and extension. Sensory exam intact to light touch bilateral upper extremities and decreased sensation to light touch in the left lower extremity.\n\nLABORATORY STUDIES:\n\nRecent laboratory values from April 12th reveals a creatinine of 1.5, glucose of 244 and calcium of 11. Liver function tests are within normal limits. Hemoglobin A1c is 6. White count of 5.2, hematocrit of 33.9 with an MCV of 81 and a platelet count of 155,000.\n\nIMAGING STUDIES:\n\nThe patient has a PET\/CT scan which was performed this morning and has not been read. To my initial evaluation, there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\n1. Mr. Danny Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital. This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma. I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son. I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable. This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy. These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region. I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found. The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma. However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process. I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg. However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology. I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.\n2. Cardiovascular: I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure. If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline, it would be important to have Cardiology on board. He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina. The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week. In follow-up, Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now. At that point, we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed. At that point, we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way. The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nGene Quadri, M.D.\n\n\nGQ\/NV\/whalen\/whalen 28-39407838.doc\n\n\n* Record date: 2097-08-28\n\n\nINTERN\/MED STUDENT ADMIT NOTE, Team 3\n\n\nName: Mr. Danny Nielson\nMR #: 9156593\nDate of admission: 08\/28\/2097\nAdmitting Physician: Dr. Gene Quadri, MD\nPCP: Dr. Ulises Noel\nSource of Hx: Patient, Available note\nCode: Full\n\nCC: Want to get my chemo\n\nID: Mr. Nielson is a 77 yoM w\/ Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s\/p 4 cycles of CHOP and 1 cycle of R-ICE who presents now for cycle 2 of R-ICE.\n\nHPI: Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until March of this year when he began noticing increasing swelling in his left leg over a period of three weeks. He also developed b\/l groin swelling greater on the left; the swelling in the left groin was tender. He presented in early April where CT and PET scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a 6.0 cm inguinal node, a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space, adenopathy in the external iliac chain (largest 3.5 cm), and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the IVC and aorta. He underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing DLBCL confimed by immunophenotyping. Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal B-cell populations and an inverted CD4\/CD8 T Cell ratio, with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation. The patient underwent his initial two cycles of CHOP in May, and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness. PET exam in early June revealed larger left groin mass, improvement in lymphadenopathy, and a small pancreatic cystic lesion. It was undetermined whether this represented treatment effect or worsening of disease.\n\nThe patient subsequently had his next two CHOP treatments in mid June and early July. PET scan and lymph node biopsy in early July revealed unchanged disease with evidence of fibrosis and inflammation. The patient was seen in clinic by Dr. Quadri twice in July, with the second visit revealing increased PET avidity and persistence of the primary mass. Given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to CHOP, the patient was evaluated by Dr. Rodgers of the WDMC one week later on 7\/28 for consideration of auto-SCT vs more aggressive chemo regimen. Due to the patient's age and consideration of risk\/benefit, it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first. Mr. Nielson was admitted on 8\/2\/2097 to receive his first cycle of R-ICE with dose-reduced Ifos and carboplatin becuase of h\/o nephrectomy. He tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia. Patient felt the R-ICE regimen was a little harder on him than the CHOP regimen. He felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days. On 8\/9, he was given 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia and on 8\/16, he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia. He was initially scheduled to receive cycle 2 of R-ICE on 8\/22 but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia. He says that he currently feels cold-intolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in May. He denies any recent N\/V, diarrhea, constipation, lightheadedness, orthostatic dizziness, hematuria, BRBPR, or melena. Side effects of note from previous cycles of chemotherapy include generalized weakness, cold-intolerance, and constipation.\n\nPMH:\n1.

He underwent salvage with two cycles of R-ICE and unfortunately continued to have PET avidity in the area. As a result, we scheduled him to begin therapy with Zevalin next Monday. He is here for a follow up physical and count check to make sure he has adequate platelets for this immunotherapy.\n\nINTERVAL HISTORY:\n\nHe describes an episode approximately one week ago of sudden onset of shortness of breath and tightness in his chest. He sat down for approximately 10 minutes, it resolved, and has not recurred since then. However, we also have the reports of a follow up PET\/CT scan which was performed yesterday which show a new accumulation of bilateral pleural effusions which the radiologist feels are most consistent with heart failure. In addition, the scans also showe the prior area of PET avidity in the leg continues, although less avid. This area is in the medial compartment of the left thigh within the adductor muscles. Mr. Nielson is not excited about this. In addition, we also have results from laboratories today which show his platelets at 88,000, so he is not eligible to begin Zevalin next week.\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n\nglyburide 10 mg\natorvastatin 10 mg daily\nfurosemide 40 mg daily\nmultiple vitamin daily\nprednisone 5 mg daily\nTylenol p.r.n.\nBactrim DS q. Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n\nWeight is 260 pounds, temperature is 97.1 degrees, heart rate is 120, blood pressure is 130\/80, and respiratory rate is 20. Pain index is 0\/10. Fatigue index is 5\/10. Heart rate is tachycardic with an ejection murmur and occasional missed beats. Lungs do have reduced breath sounds bilaterally.\n\nLABORATORY STUDIES:\n\nWhite blood cell count is 3.2, hematocrit is 33.5, hemoglobin is 11.4, platelet count 88,000, neutrophil count is 2.45. Chemistries examination reveals sodium of 141, potassium of 3, chloride of 104, carbon dioxide of 28.3, calcium of 9.1, BUN of 24, creatinine of 1.6, total protein 6.3, albumin of 3.7, total bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 58, SGPT of 21, SGOT of 22, and LDH of 208.\n\nASSESSMENT\/PLAN:\n\nGiven his current status, we have decided to transfer him to the emergency department today for further evaluation of his cardiac symptoms, particularly to rule out myocardial infarction and assess whether he is, indeed, in new heart failure We attempted to contact cardiology for an outpatient evaluation, but we were unable to do so.Therefore, he will be transported to the emergency department for an emergent workup of his new symptoms. I suspect he will be admitted. Hopefully, they will be able to get his cardiac issues under control. Unfortunately, from an oncologic point of view, it is uncertain whether his platelet count will reach at least 100,000 in order to give this man therapy. As a potential other therapy, we will discuss the ability of radiation oncology to increase the number of cGy to that local area considering he only received 30 at the onset.\n\n\n\nEdward Quiambao, PA-C\n\ncc: Dr. Ulises Lopez, MAH\n\nEQ\/sharpe 39-90766020.doc\n\n\n* Record date: 2098-02-22\n\nKekela Team 3 Intern Admission\nName: Danny Nielson MR#: 9156593 Admit Date: February 21, 2098 Onc Attending: Dr. Quadri Onc PA: Edward Quiambao PCP: Ulises Lopez Admitting intern: Ulyssa Neff Code: FULL\nSource: Patient\nChief Complaint: diarrhea\nHistory of Present Illness: 77-year-old gentleman with Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s\/p 4 cycles of CHOP-R with increased PET avidity of left groin nodal mass and biopsy c\/w DLBCL then s\/p R-ICE cycle #2.

He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11\/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left. However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side. This lasted for ~24 hours. He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis. He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12\/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx. He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and\/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.

In anticipation for a follow-up cardiac catheterization (recent episodes of shortness of breath), his coumadin was held since Thursday (3\/6\/2081). Then on 3\/7\/2081, he was noted by medical staff to have a slightly cool L lower extremity. The patient states that it has felt this way with some intermittent pain at rest for the last several weeks. He complained of both numbness and pain, and he was started on a heparin drip when his INR fell to less than 2.0. Dr. Atwood who did his initial operation was contacted and he was arranged for transfer to RCH.

This was complicated by a postoperative MI. 03\/15\/2081, cardiac catheterization is significant for left main and multivessel coronary artery disease, and CABG was planned. Of note, his cath was complicated by pseudoaneurysm of the right brachial artery at the point of access.

Linear filling defect in the apical segmental artery of the left upper lobe could represent chronic embolus. 2.Suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins. Evaluation of DVT is suboptimal. Ultrasound of the lower extremities for deep indicated to rule out DVT clinically indicated. 3.Evaluation of pulmonary parenchyma somewhat limited respiratory motion. There is bilateral subsegmental atelectasis. The patient has undergone prior lower lobe wedge resection. 4. There are multiple mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, which are some centimeters in size. They are slightly more prominent than in the previous exam. The right hilar lymph node now measures 0.9 cm in short axis. The visualized thyroid gland appears normal. There are atherosclerotic vascular calcifications of the coronary arteries.\n5. Legs: There is suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins limiting evaluation for deep venous thrombosis. Doppler ultrasound would be indicated to look for DVT. Significant bilateral degenerative changes of the hips are seen.\n*\nAssessment:\n64F with h\/o NSCLC, COPD, CHF who presents with 36 hours of increasing SOB and a feeling that the fluid is coming back. Has been on increasing doses on furosemide this week which has improved edema per patient but breathing is still worse today. No other major symptoms.\n\nPlan:\n\n\n# SOB Patient presents with increasing SOB in the context of increasing ankle size and sense that she is hypervolemic. Increased lasix has improved her fluid status but did not fully resolve her respiratory issue, which is worse today than yesterday. Differential includes CHF with fluid overload, PE, malignancy with obstructive component, PNA, or COPD exacerbation with viral infection. Increasing pulmonary hypertension a concern (h\/o hypoventilation syndrome, RVH on echo, worsening dyspnea). -Large acute PE ruled out with CT -? of whether mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes have increased in size since previous, no other obvious progression of NSCLC, CT findings would not account for her dyspnea -CXR and CT negative for acute PNA -CXR and CT show mild atalectasis, possible interstitial fluid, but show no effusions or other significant signs of fluid overload. BNP is not very high. However, patient has poor PFTs and small change in volume status may tip her into respiratory distress. Cough c\/w increased volume or viral infection -Plan is to continue with diuresis as volume overload is most likely explanation of her respiratory status, furosemide 80 mg BID with PRN lasix as needed to maintain fluid status -500-1.0 L tomorrow. Avoiding more aggressive diuresis as she has a history of over-diuesis with ARF.\n-Continue home Tiotropium, Albuterol, Fluticasone Prop\/Salmeterol 500\/50 (Advair Diskus 500\/50)\n# NSCLC Likely not the cause of tonight's presentation with acute SOB, although chest CT must be re-evaluated for possible evidence of cancer. Mild or no increased size of mediastinal lymph nodes may be concerning. -F\/U with Dr. Lacey in AM, patient wants all information regarding imaging results and prognosis directly from Dr. Lacey -Appt already scheduled for July 13th with Dr. Lacey for f\/u\n#Anxiety\/Depression Patient prescribed clonazepam 0.25 BID but is taking it 0.25 in AM, 0.25 in PM, and additional 0.5 QHS for significant anxiety.

According to the patient, she left the hospital, completed the course of Tamiflu and azithromycin on 2\/24, and continued to feel poorly, with a chronic nagging cough that was productive of dark green sputum. No fever, chills, sweats, myalgias, or SOB. Yesterday, she developed worsening pain, especially in her ribs, extending across the anterior surface; she said the pain is worse with movement but does not vary with respiration or cough. She is unable to ambulate, as she states she does at baseline with a walker.\n\nThis is her tenth hospital and fourteenth ED visit to MCH in the past year (there are records in the chart of OSH visits as well).

Two weeks prior to her presentation\nto the Parkview Memorial Hospital she underwent a stent placement to\nher SMA. After stent placement she was discharged to rehab, and then\nreturned to the emergency room complaining of severe sudden onset of\nright lower quadrant pain. CT scan of the abdomen showed cecal\nthickening with fat stranding locally. She subsequently was taken to\nthe operating room. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated and she\nwas discharged to Hendry Hospital where she had remained until May.\n\nHer complaints today include some constipation, which she is relating\nto iron intake. She is going to use some stool softeners and some milk\nof magnesia for this. She also has some diaphoresis at nighttime,\nwhich she reports has occurred prior to her hospitalization.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise, today she denies fever, chills, chest\npain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain,\nor calf pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: On physical exam she is healthy appearing in no apparent\ndistress. She is accompanied today by her daughter. Her weight is 164\npounds. Her vital signs are 103\/80, 70, 16, 96.6. Her abdomen is\nsoft, nontender and nondistended.

Ms. Etheridge has a history of coronary artery disease, stating that she has a heart problem. She is unable to give more details at the present time. Per old records, she carries the diagnosis of CAD and diastolic heart failure EF 55%.\nShe was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began to complain of a cold. She felt chills, even though it was warm in her house. That day she suffered a mechanical fall, slipping on a blanket in her home. She hit her left eye, but denies LOC. The next day, she was achy all over, noted a dry cough, and was wheezy. The day prior to admission, she states that she couldn't breath and had to come into the ER.\nOn arrival to WGH at 11:30AM 01\/18\/88 vitals were: P 93 BP 121\/82 RR 22 96% on room air. She had a prolonged ER course of 31 hours duration. Initially, she was treated for presumed COPD flare with nebulizers, prednisone and doxycycline. A rapid flu test was positive for influenza A. She received 1 liter of normal saline. Approximately 6 hours later, she complained of 7\/10 mid sternal chest pain, non-radiating. EKG showed: sinus tachycardia @115bpm, with STE 1mm AVR, and STD II, V3-V5. Her pain came to 1\/10 with 2L NTG and Ativan. Small doses of IV lopressor were given. STDs partially resolved. Around 10AM the day of admission (01\/19\/88) her blood pressure acutely rose to 190 systolics, her heart rate increased to 106bpm. Per the patient, she remembers having a coughing fit, and being unable to catch her breath. She was placed on CPAP, then switched to BiPAP for ABG: 125\/78\/7.13. She was felt clinically to be in flash pulmonary edema. She was treated with nebulizers, intravenous TNG, lasix and BiPAP. With improvement in hemodynamics, her pain and shortness of breath improved. Enzymes were drawn and showed: trop 0.22, CK 122, MB 11.7. She was started on heparin, integrillin (though unclear if she received it).\nThe patient currently denies pain.

Pt reports she has had a bladder infection off and on for the past several months manifesting as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria. Went to WGH Pecos clinic 1 wk pta and received fosfamycin. Went back on Tue w no resolution of sx and says med was changed (? to nitrofurantoin per ED pass-off). On Friday AM, woke up with sob. Felt bloated in her stomach and had difficulty w breathing when trying to get dressed. Sob much worse w activity, would resolve w lying down, associated w diaphoresis. Pt denies CP at the time of the episode (reports some subsequent short-lived R-sided CP in WGH ED, similar to R-sided CP she has had off and on for awhile wh she did not mention to the ED staff). Denies palpitations, arm or jaw pain. Denies increase in LE edema, no recent change in meds, excellent medication regimen compliance, not a lot of salt in diet, and no recent diet changes. Pt does sleep on mult pillows but says she does this because of her reflux disease. Pt does think she had similar sob 1-2 yrs ago when she was admitted to WGH, told she had CHF, and was diuresed. Because of her symptoms on Friday 12\/09\/88, pt went into WGH Pecos clinic. Per Pecos note, EKG at that time showed ST depressions in I,aVL, V5, V6, II\/III\/aVF. Pt received ASA 325 and lasix 40 mg IV, and was sent to WGH ED.\n\nED Course: On arrival to WGH ED, pt had VS T 98.2, P 74, BP 160\/70, RR 24, O2 Sat 95% RA.

Pt has been undergoing treament for persistent UTI. While sob is likely multifactorial from CHF and COPD, COPD exacerbated by recent illness is most likely etiology. CHF is argued against by: normal BNP (especially in comparison to elevated BNP in 6000s on prior admission for CHF), clear CXR, clear lung exam, and pt is still having exertional CP similar to what she felt on AM of admission. If one believes her EKGs demonstrated ischemic changes, this would support an explanation that her sob is an anginal equivalent. However, ST changes appear minimal on close evaluation of EKG changes. Cardiac enzymes are negative so far.\n\nPlan:\n1. SOB\na. Cont to cycle cardiac enzymes. Negative so far.\nb. Cont tele\nc. Atrovent and albuterol nebs\nd. Cont home lasix dose for now.

The patient is awake, alert, in mild to moderate\nrespiratory distress, breathing with a respiratory rate at 34,\noximetry noted at 88% on room air, temperature is 102 Fahrenheit,\npulse is 104, blood pressure is 213\/89, and oximetry came up\nnicely to 93% on 4 liters and 100% on nonrebreather facemask.\nNeck is supple. Mucous membranes are dry. Lungs reveal slightly\ndecreased breath sounds at the bases; however, there are few\ncrackles noted in the left lower base. Heart is tachycardic but\nregular. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable.\nLABORATORY DATA: White count is noted at 11.6 and hematocrit\n28.2. This is close to the patient's baseline. BUN and\ncreatinine 69 and 5.8, 5.8 is quite elevated for this patient.\nHowever, he has been evaluated for recent diagnosis of renal\nfailure by the Nephrology Service. Bicarbonate is 21 and\npotassium is 4.3. Urinalysis reveals some blood and protein,\notherwise not suggestive of an infection. EKG is tachycardic\nwith left ventricular hypertrophy in a strain pattern. Chest\nx-ray shows diffuse fluffy infiltrates bilaterally with bilateral\npleural effusions, few Kerley B lines, and fluid in the lungs\nfissures.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was covered with\nceftriaxone and azithromycin for his presumed pneumonia. He also\nreceived nitro paste for preload reduction as well as a Foley\ncatheter and Lasix, all for his CHF.\nDISPOSITION: The patient was admitted to the hospital.\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\nDIAGNOSES: Pneumonia, CHF, and renal failure.\n\nSORENSEN, SAUL\nD: 08\/13\/79\nT: 08\/13\/79\nDictated By: SORENSEN, SAUL\neScription document:4-5119504 BFFocus\n\n\n* Record date: 2080-11-09\nMANAMANA INPATIENT RENAL TRANSPLANT ADMIT NOTE\n\nReferring Physician: Dr. Amar Jacoby\n\nOutpatient Nephrologist: Dr. Pao Arias\n\nReason for Admission: Living unrelated renal transplant\nCMV status: Donor negative, Recipient Negative\nHLA: share one HLA-B and HLA-DR locus antigen, negative cross-match\nInduction: Simulect, Prograf, MMF, steroid taper\n\nHPI: 76-year-old man with history of per-ESRD 2\/2 DM, HTN underwent pre-emptive living unrelated (stepson) renal transplant on 11\/08\/80.

Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out. She was found to have a blood\npressure of 250 systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent\nheadaches. She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being\nfound collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom. She was transferred to the\nIntensive Care Unit at Neligh Clinic and treated for tonic-clonic\nconvulsions with diazepam and lorazepam. She also suffered a urinary tract\ninfection in hospital, treated with Cipro.\n\nShe was transferred to the American Legion Hospital on October 02, 2089,\nat which time she was awake but unable to give a history.\n\nOn admission to American Legion Hospital she had a blood pressure of\n127\/70, pulse was 80, and temperature was 99.3. She had a myxedematous face and\nwas obese. She was cardiovascularly stable. Neurologically, she was able to move\nall four extremities with good strength and symmetrical reflexes. Cranial nerves\nintact. Initially, the impression was that patient suffered seizure secondary to\nelevated blood pressure. Most likely, she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy.\nPatient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain, lumbar\npuncture, both of which were negative. Electroencephalogram was performed and\nshowed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally. The patient's\nalertness and responsiveness increased gradually during the hospital stay. She had\nan episode of chest pain which was associated with some ST flattening in the lateral\nleads. Acute cardiac event was ruled out. The patient underwent a course of\nphysical therapy and then, finally, was transferred to a rehabilitation facility. A\nspecific cause of the patient's seizure was not found although it was assumed that\nthis might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with\nuse of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her\nthreshold for seizure activity. Upon discharge, the patient was in stable condition.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for seizure, type II diabetes mellitus,\npanhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary surg, hypertension, right arm bone\ntumor excision associated with right radial neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia.\n\nMEDICATIONS: See LMR.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Negative.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Denies alcohol intake, smoking.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Denies visual or hearing disturbance, headaches,\nweakness, numbness, seizure activity, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, dyspnea,\nwheezing, cough, coryza, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain.\n\nPositive for mild nocturia with no dysuria.

Patient confused and unable to give history at time of admission. As per son and daughter, they have noticed increasing confusion and inappropriate behavior over the past 3 days. They report that she has woken up in the middle of the night c\/o feeling weak and confused. The first two nights, her son treated her initially with increasing lactulose administration when she would wake up at night (although it is unclear whether she had any increase in her stool) and he reports that she would behave better during the day. On the night prior to administration, the patient urinated in her bed at night and called her daughter on the phone in the middle of the night. She also forgot the names of her grandchildren.

BP was 200\/96 when EMS arrived. Here her SBP was in the 220s with heart rate in the 50-60s. Her initial exam revealed somnolence, but able to follow some very simple commands like squeezing hand, nodding head; she had right gaze deviation, left hemianopsia, left facial palsy, left arm and leg plegia, right arm and leg paresis, and dysarthria. She received 10 mg of hydralazine for her SBP greater than 220. CT revealed a right basal ganglia\/thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, 7 mm mls to the left, contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality. She was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a-line placed for Bp monitoring and management.\n\nAt baseline, Ms. Olivo is wheelchair-bound, according to her daughter, due to her neuropathy.

Briefly, this patient has history of back pain, L buttock and leg pain for which he has been scheduled for an outpt open MRI next week. The pain was worse in the last few days such that he has had difficulty walking due to pain. He does not have any weakness or numbness no loss of control of bowel or bladder. No fevers\/chills.

The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance. Given the patient's history of prostate CA, he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well. Pt was offered MRI today, however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI (he has tried before with medications). Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits, it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f\/u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week. Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms.\nCondition on Discharge\nStable\nDiagnoses\nBack pain\nReview Comments\nI have personally seen and examined the patient and confirmed the resident's examination, reviewed and agree with the resident's documentation of history, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care and disposition of the patient with the resident.\n\nThis note has been electronically signed by TERESA LAMB, MD 9\/13\/2150 7:30:19 PM\n\nClinical staff documenting in the ED note include:\n\nAttending\/Nurse Practitioners(s)\n\nTERESA LAMB, MD\nBRIANNA WILKES, NP\nVETRA MOON, NP\n\n* Record date: 2151-01-25\nJanuary 25, 2151 (initial office note) Frank Caldwell: He is a 75 year old man who is referred by Dr. Freda Erickson of Mauston for consultation regarding a biopsy proven adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas. He apparently developed some twinge type pain in his right upper quadrant which he describes as zingers 6 or 7 weeks ago. Work-up then involved imaging with a CT scan which I reviewed but do not have the written report on. This shows a mass in the head of the pancreas abutting and perhaps distorting the portal vein. He has not had any jaundice and does not have any change in his bowel functions. A subsequent endoscopic ultrasound examination confirms the mass in the head of the pancreas with features of portal vein invasion. Fine needle aspiration has confirmed adenocarcinoma. The mass itself is about 2 cm in diameter. His family history does not include any pancreatic cancer but his father had lung cancer. He denies smoking, drinking but exercises by walking about 5 days a week. His past surgical history includes a resection of an aortic aneurysm in 2131, cholecystectomy in 2131, prostatectomy for cancer in 2142 and resection of a lung cancer in 2143. His current medications include Lipitor 40mg a day, Glyburide 5mg three times a day (he has been taking it for 6 7 years), Lisinopril 5mg a day and a baby aspirin. He is said to be allergic to Sudafed and the dye used for CAT scans (the latter was apparently salivary gland swelling on the day following a CAT scan - - it is unclear whether the two are related). His review of systems also includes kidneys stones and spinal stenosis. He has had some mild recent weight loss. He denies symptoms of heart disease, neurologic disease or respiratory disease. His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable. I think he is not a candidate for attempted surgical resection at this time. With the findings consistent with portal vein invasion, he should first be treated with chemoradiation. He may be a candidate for subsequent surgery, probably not resection but perhaps intra-operative radiation therapy. I ve explained this to him, his wife and daughter. After discussing the various alternatives we have agreed to have him evaluated in the Sawtooth Cancer Clinic for treatment planning for chemoradiation, with consideration of subsequent IORT. He comes from Elk Ridge and probably would prefer to have his treatment carried out at the Elk Ridge Health Center in coordination with us. This seems quite reasonable and we will proceed to set that up. I will also get a CA19-9 today and plan to see him at the completion of his chemoradiation. I spent 45 minutes in consultation and coordination of care. Benjaman Y.

His medical history includes: 1. Hypertension. He is currently on hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d. and aspirin q.d. 2. Hypercholesterolemia. The patient is on 30 mg q.h.s. of simvastatin. His last lipid panel in April of this year showed total cholesterol of 196, triglycerides 169, HDL 52, and LDL of 110. He has no LFTs on file. 3. Psychiatry. According to the patient, he carried a diagnosis of major depression with paranoid features. He is being followed by Dr. Uhler, psychiatrist at Marshfield Clinic as well as Betty Villasenor, a therapist at Marshfield Clinic. He is currently on Depakote, Tegretol, Risperdal, and Paxil although he does not know the doses of his medications. He still feels depressed but his paranoid symptoms have subsided. He has no manic or hypermanic episodes.\nMEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.d, Paxil, Risperdal, Tegretol, Depakote doses unknown, simvastatin 30 mg q.h.s, HCTZ 20 mg q.d.\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. He quit drinking alcohol 16 years ago. He has not been sexually active for 16 years and is currently not interested. He lives by himself in Denver Drive, walks about 20 minutes per day, and is from Louisa originally.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Mother and father died of MIs in their 70s. There is no history of sudden cardiac death. No cancer, liver, kidney, or thyroid disease in the family.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 132\/84, heart rate 84, and weight 202 pounds. The remainder of the exam is deferred.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Hypertension. The patient is well controlled on his current regimen. I will therefore not change anything today. 2. Hypercholesterolemia. The patient is at his goal LDL level. I will continue to follow his lipid panel yearly. I will also check LFTs today, given that he had a statin. 3. Psychiatry. The patient will follow up with his psychiatrist and therapist. He will let me know his actual medication and medication doses at his earliest convenience. Also, I will recheck an LFT as stated above, given that he is on possibly hepatotoxic psychoactive medications. 4. Healthcare maintenance. I have emphasized to the patient the benefits of weight reduction as well as increasing his exercise. He is not interested in any exercise as in walking and I have therefore counseled him to walk longer and faster. He had a negative flexible sigmoidoscopy in November 2083 and I will give him stool cards today. His last tetanus was 10 years ago and he is not interested in the booster today. His immunizations are otherwise up to date according to him and he will need the remainder of the history and a full physical exam at the next visit in 3 months' time.\nWyatt Yeo, M.D.\neScription document:0-726841 CFFocus\nDD: 08\/21\/85 DT: 08\/22\/85 DV: 08\/21\/85\n\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\n\n\nAugust 21st\n\nDr Yeo Mr Wilkerson\n\n61 year old man Hx hypertension.Hx elev cholesterol, on zocor.

I have seen and\nexamined the patient personally, reviewed the written\ndocumentation and agree with the assessment and plan.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Wilkerson is a 68-year-old\ngentleman without significant past medical history, who is\nactually being seen here by his primary care physician who\nhappens to be a resident rotating normally sees him in MIMAIMA\nClinic. According to Dr. Caldwell, his PCP, he generally does\nnot have very much past medical history, but when he gets\ninfected, he gets confused. He presents today with confusion.\nHis visiting nurse today noticed that he has been having weakness\nand fatigue over the last few days, but today, he was confused as\nhe has been when he has been ill in the past.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Dementia, SVT, hypertension, and diabetes\ntype 2.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He is a former smoker.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Otherwise, negative.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative except as previously\ndictated.\nMEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, omeprazole,\nRisperdal, Tegretol, verapamil, and Tylenol #3.\nALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a healthy, well-appearing Caucasian\ngentleman who nevertheless is disoriented to time. He knows\nplace and name. His heart rate is 101, respiratory rate is 20,\nblood pressure is 121\/92, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room\nair, and his temperature is 101.5. He had left lower lobe\ncrackles in his lung exam. The remainder of his physical exam\nwas otherwise normal. Mucus membranes were moist. Abdomen was\nsoft. Extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\nLABORATORY DATA: The patient had a normal chest x-ray, negative\nurinalysis. White blood cell count was 7.12. He had a\ncreatinine of 1.24, up from his baseline and a lactate of 3.8.\nHis chest x-ray showed no acute process.\nIMPRESSION: My impression is that the patient has severe sepsis\nby virtue of evidence of change in his mental status and his\ncreatinine, he was given a liter of normal saline in the\nEmergency Department as a bolus. Given that pneumonia and\nurinary tract infection were highest on the list, we decided to\ntreat him with Rocephin and azithromycin.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT: This 71 year old female status post cardiac cath stent placement and then later EP study states that she was doing well until last night when she started to ooze from the groin site. She did not apply any pressure. She states that she was bleeding through the night, did not want to bother her brother, called Dr. Aponte today who told her to come in. She states that she did not know where the site was. She could not see it and she did not apply pressure. She has no chest pain, no shortness of breath. She is not dizzy. She is on Lovenox and Coumadin both. She has not had her PT checked. The rest of the systems were reviewed and are negative. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Depression, cardiac cath, hypothyroidism. MEDICATIONS: Taken from the chart. ALLERGIES: Taken from the chart. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her brother. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her heart rate was 81, her temperature is 96.5 degrees, blood pressure is 123\/64. This is a well-developed female, alert, oriented. HEENT exam is atraumatic, normocephalic. Neck is soft and supple. Mouth and throat are normal. Well-hydrated moist mucosa. Conjunctiva are clear. Sclerae are non-icteric. There is no jugular venous distention. Heart had a regular rate and rhythm. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen was soft, nontender. No guarding. No hepatosplenomegaly. There is a hematoma at the right groin. The cath site was about 1 cm and closed but there was some small oozing from the site. It stopped with pressure. The patient was covered in blood and blood clots. The old dressing was removed. All the dried blood and blood clots were removed. The patient was cleaned up by myself. Then, the nurses put her in the hospital gown. LABORATORY EVALUATION: PT, PTT, CBC were obtained. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: After speaking with the patient at length, it seems that she lives with her older brother. She is caring for him and is a bit overwhelmed with this. Obviously, her medical knowledge base is not adequately prepared to deal with this problem. She will be admitted to the Observation Area through the day for nurse training. Social Services will be consulted to arrange for a home visiting nurse. Dr. Aponte was called. CONSULTATIONS (including PCP): Social Services and Dr. Aponte. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Bleeding from cath site and knowledge deficit. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): See the chart for disposition.

She also has had hypertension and elevated lipids\nover approximately the same period of time. She has a complicated history\nincluding lung cancer and colon cancer, both treated and in remission. Her\ncreatinine has been rising gradually over recent years with a value of 1.0 in 2062,\n1.2 in May 2063, 2.1 and 1.8 in early 2064 with 2.3 in May 2064, and recently 3.1\nobtained on July 06, 2064.\n\nShe has been quite anemic in the recent months with a hematocrit level of 24.9.\nHer serum folate, B12, and iron and are not particularly low, and MCV is normal\nat 81. Urinalysis showed 3+ albumin in September 2062 and persisting\nproteinuria since that time. Dr. Yeomans obtained an ultrasound examination in\nMarch, which showed diffusely thinned renal cortices, but no evidence of\nobstruction, stones, or masses.\n\nShe has visited an ophthalmologist regularly for macular degeneration. She does\nnot know whether signs of diabetes are present, but she has had no laser treatment\nfor any proliferative retinopathy.\n\nRecently, she has been feeling unusually fatigued with diminished appetite and\nalmost constant nausea. She vomits rarely. Her weight has fallen by about 20\npounds. She is slightly constipated. She is moderately dyspneic on exertion. She\nis not troubled by muscle cramps or by unusual itching of her skin.\n\nHer medications continue as listed with ACE inhibitors, statins, and a rather\nlarge dose of Lasix at 80 mg twice a day.\n\nMedications\nPaxil 20.0 MG PO 1 TAB QD\nSynthroid 0.05 MG PO 1 TAB QD\nMultivitamins 1 TAB QD\nOne Touch Test Strips : As directed.\nLORAZEPAM 0.5 MG PO 1 TAB QD\nAccupril (QUINAPRIL) 10 MG PO 1 TAB QD\nCalcium Gluconate 500MG, 2 Tablet(s) PO BID\nSerevent (SALMETEROL) 2 PUFFS NAS BID\nAtrovent Inhaler (IPRATROPIUM Inhaler) 2 PUFFS NAS BID\nEcasa (ASPIRIN Enteric Coated) 81MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO 1 TAQD\nLasix (FUROSEMIDE) 80MG, 2 Tablet(s) PO BID\nLopressor (METOPROLOL Tartrate) 50MG, 0.5 Tablet(s) PO BID\nFe Gluconate (FERROUS Gluconate) 325MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO TID\nGlucophage (METFORMIN) 500MG, 2 Tablet(s) PO : 2 tabs po qam, 2 tabs po qpm.\nCaltrate 600 1 TAB PO BID\nAvandia (ROSIGLITAZONE) 4MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO BID\nOcuvite (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 TAB PO QD\nFosamax (ALENDRONATE) 70MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO QWEEK\nPrilosec (OMEPRAZOLE) 20MG, 1 Capsule(s) PO BID\nLipitor 40 MG PO 1 TAB QD\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination today, she looks tired but\nreasonably comfortable. She speaks in a high-pitched somewhat hoarse voice,\nwhich has persisted since one of her surgical procedures. Her blood pressure in\nthe right arm, sitting, is 148\/60 with regular pulse 72. Her chest has a few basal\ncrackles but in general is clear and air moves comfortably. JVP fills below the\nsternal angle heart shows a grade 2 systolic murmur, loudest at the upper left\nsternal border. Abdomen is soft and nontender. There is no renal tenderness.\nExtremities have no edema.\n\nIMPRESSION: Progressive renal failure in a 74-year-old woman with more than\n10 years' history of diabetes as well has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The\nproteinuria, if confirmed, would support the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but\nthis would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy. It would be useful to know\nfrom her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present. It is, of course, also\npossible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys. Their symmetry and\nthe presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility. The ACE\ninhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum\ncreatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat. Her loss of appetite and\nnausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia, RD, a renal\ndietitian, to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and\nhyperlipidemia. This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea. It think it\nwould be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and\nperhaps her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with\nless ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume. If, of course, shortness of\nbreath worsens or edema appears, then returning to the Lasix would be\nreasonable. It might be that a longer acting, milder diuretic, such as 5 mg of\nmetolazone might help to control edema (and potassium) and reduce the\nrequirement for Lasix. If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and\ndiuresis, it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural, and it might\nbe then possible to return to these medicines with less worry.\n\nHer anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit\nfrom instituting therapy with Epogen (such as 4000 units twice a week) or\nAranesp).\n\nPLAN: We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio, which may\nhelp us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy. If so, the\nmeasures proposed would be appropriate. We discussed the eventual probable\nneed for dialysis (assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes). It would\nbe useful for her to visit the DCGH Renal Department (located here on our\nfloor at 592G, along with Ms. Xia's office) to learn about modes of dialysis.\nWe discussed construction of a forearm fistula, which should be done well before\na need for it arises. I would, in fact, recommend that she proceed to have this\ndone in the next few months. This could be arranged through Dr. Xaysana's office\nor perhaps by speaking with Dr. Najee Yuan. I will, of course, help with any of\nthese measures as necessary.\n\n\n\n\nXander Xie, M.D.\n\n\nWanda\nUrine total protein\/creatinine ratio is only 0.11 (corresponding to about 0.1 g\/day or proteinuria). This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy, and argues in favor of vascular disease. I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction. If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration.\n\nKyle\n\n* Record date: 2064-08-11\nDCGH Cancer Center\n\nDiagnosis:\n1. Colon cancer\n2.

At the beginning of this year, she began to have intermittent burning pain of her feet and sometimes her lower legs\/feet. This pain typically occurred on one leg more than the other, without an overall predominance of one side. In the past month, she has had continuous, bilateral burning pain that began in both feet. Several weeks ago, her pain worsened considerably such that she was having difficulty shopping. Around this time, the pain spread up her legs to above her knees. She also noted having difficulty putting on shoes and was told by a friend that her feet were swollen (she is unable to see her feet due to blindness). Her pain continued to worsen until the night prior to admission, when she was in her bathroom and found herself in such pain that she was unable to get up to leave the bathroom. A friend found her after 8 hours and EMS was called. In the ED, she was found to have BP elevated to 190, Cr elevated to 2.8, FSG down to 51, and R-sided hydronephrosis. Labetolol\/diltiazem were given for HTN with good response, IV hydration was given with subsequent decline in Cr, and Foley was placed with resolution of hydronephrosis on subsequent MRI.\nShe has never had burning pain of the kind that she presented with prior to this year. Of note, she has had years of tingling without numbness in her lower extremities bilaterally extending to above her knees. She also notes numbness of the tips of her R 2nd-4th digits.

She was found to have exquisitely tender joints up to and including her knees with visible synovial effusions of her knees bilaterally. Aspiration of one of her knees revealed needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals, diagnostic of gout. This is consistent with her elevated uric acid and her elevated markers of inflammation (ESR\/CRP). Given that she has a long history of symptoms of LE diabetic neuropathy and that she has some diffuse soft tissue tenderness, she may also have some pain from diabetic neuropathy that may declare itself after her gout is treated. However, her current inability to walk can be clearly attributed to gout.\nRecs: - Solumedrol 40 mg bid IV, prednisone 40 mg qd starting tomorrow with 12-day outpatient taper (40 mg x 3 days, 30 mg x 3 days, 20 mg x 3 days, 10 mg x 3 days) - Colchicine po 0.6 mg qd for 2 weeks, then 0.6 mg qod for 2 weeks - Continue to hold HCTZ discuss with PCP need to restart as outpatient as it is a risk factor for hyperuricemia - F\/u with rheumatology in 4 weeks for initiation of allopurinol (please arrange appointment w\/ Dr. Yau)\n\nProcedure: R knee aspiration Patient was informed of the risks of bleeding and infection and gave consent.

The patient has\nbeen in Southwest Montana for the last several weeks. During her\nrehabilitation stay, the patient was noted to have sinus\nbradycardia and sinus pauses. The patient's metoprolol was\nstopped. The patient was previously on metoprolol 6.25 mg every\n6 hours. The patient was noted to have atrial fibrillation with\nrapid ventricular response on exam this morning. The patient is\nfollowed by Dr. Octavia Xue of Heritage Hospital Cardiology.\nGiven the difficulty that Southwest Montana has had\nthe patient's atrial fibrillation, the patient was transferred\nhere to Riverton General Hospital for further management and\nfurther placement. The patient is asymptomatic. The patient\ndenies any chest pain or shortness of breath. The patient denies\nany lightheadedness. The patient has no other complaints.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient's vital signs revealed the\nfollowing: Temperature is 96.4, heart rate of 79, respiratory\nrate of 18, blood pressure is 112\/63, and oxygen saturations at\n100% on room air. The patient's oxygen saturation was\ninterpreted as normal. General: No acute distress, pleasant,\nand multiple family members at bedside. HEENT: The patient's\nhead was normocephalic. Mucous membranes were dry. Posterior\noropharynx was clear. Neck: Supple. No carotid bruits. No\nJVD. Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No focal\nrhonchi, rales, or wheezes. Cardiovascular: Irregularly\nirregular, tachycardic. No gross murmurs, rubs, or gallops were\nappreciated. GI: Abdomen: Soft. No rebound or guarding.\nMinimal suprapubic tenderness to palpation. G-tube in place.\nRectal exam: Deferred. GU exam: Deferred. Skin: Warm and\ndry. No rash or lesions were noted. Back: No costovertebral\nangle tenderness. Extremities: Warm and well perfused. Lower\nextremity pitting edema rising up to the knees. No palpable\ncords. Neurologic: The patient was alert and oriented. The\npatient moved all 4 extremities with fair strength. The patient\ndid have a right facial droop. I did not ambulate the patient.\nINITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a 78-year-old female\nwith history of atrial fibrillation, and recent left MCA stroke\nwho was transferred from Southwest Montana for management\nof her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The\npatient is hemodynamically stable at this time. The patient is\nasymptomatic. The patient will need rate control and will need\nto be admitted to Heritage Hospital Cardiology.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: Upon arrival to the Emergency\nDepartment, the patient had history and physical exam performed.\nThe patient then had 12-lead EKG performed. The patient's\n12-lead EKG was notable for atrial fibrillation with rapid\nventricular response. The patient did have some nonspecific ST-T\nchanges when compared to her prior EKG. The patient's laboratory\nstudies so far has been largely unremarkable. The patient's\nfirst set of cardiac markers were negative. The patient's\ncomplete blood count was notable for an elevated white blood cell\ncount of 10.8. The patient's hematocrit of 33.2. The patient's\nplatelets were somewhat elevated at 560,000. The patient's\nportable chest x-ray has been ordered and results of the\npatient's portable chest x-ray are still pending at this time.\nThe case was then discussed with the Heritage Hospital\ncardiologist on call. The patient will be admitted to\nHeritage Hospital Cardiology and to a monitor bed. I did try to\npage Dr. Octavia Xue to let her know about the patient's\nadmission to Heritage Hospital Cardiology. The patient and\npatient's family were in agreement with the plan. The patient\nwas started on metoprolol down her G-tube. The patient had a\ngood response to the metoprolol. The patient was given\nmetoprolol 6.25 mg.\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSES:\n1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.\n2. History of a left MCA stroke.\nDISPOSITION: The patient was admitted to Heritage Hospital\nCardiology.\nCONDITION AT TIME OF DISPOSITION: Stable and satisfactory.\n\nTAVARES, IDRIS M.D.\nD: 07\/19\/80\nT: 07\/19\/80\nDictated By: TAVARES, IDRIS\neScription document:4-5337537 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2070-10-08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 8, 2070\n\n\nThomas You, M.D.\n743 Gilson Road\nVernon, ME 27525\n\nRE: Jaquante Xuereb\nSRI: 134-43-51\n\nDear Dr. You:\n\nThank you for asking me to consult in the care of this complex patient. Mr. Xuereb is a 55-year-old white male who presents with an ischemic right foot. He has a longstanding history of lower extremity occlusive disease and has worked as a high school principle. He has undergone previous right SFA angioplasty in 2059, previous left SFA angioplasty and stent placement in 2062, previous right fem-pop above-knee bypass grafting in February 2070, previous left leg fem-pop bypass grafting with saphenous vein in April 2070 and a redo right fem below-knee popliteal bypass graft with a bifid saphenous vein performed in September 2070. After this last procedure, the patient at the time of follow-up office visit was noted to have a nonfunctioning graft with an ischemic right lower extremity. He denies any history of trauma. He is a former smoker. He denies any history of hypercoagulable states or history of significant coronary disease. He does have longstanding non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and COPD.\n\nPast surgical history is as above.\n\nMedications include Glucophage, Lopid, Prilosec, Norvasc, hydrochlorothiazide, Lipitor, Effexor, Plavix 75 mg q.d, aspirin, albuterol, Serevent, Nasacort and Pulmicort.\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\nReview of systems is positive for diabetes, asthma and hypertension. All other review of systems is negative as per H&P sheet.\n\nHabits, he is a former tobacco smoker. He denies alcohol use.\n\nFamily history is positive for MI, stroke and cancer.\n\nOn physical exam, the patient is a well-developed and well-nourished male in moderate discomfort. Respiratory rate is 12-14. Pulse is 60-70 and regular. Weight is 172 pounds. Blood pressure is 170\/90 in the right arm, 150\/90 in the left. No jugular venous distention. Normal respiratory effort. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart, regular rate and rhythm. No murmur or bruit. He has no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm. He has normal carotid, brachial, radial and femoral pulses bilaterally. Absent pedal pulses on the right with Doppler signals, which are monophasic. On the left side, he has adequately perfused foot with normal capillary refill and Doppler signals. He has moderate edema in the right lower extremity. No varicosities. He does have dependent rubor, cyanosis of the right forefoot and purplish discoloration of the tips of the right second to fifth toes. The right great toe is blanched. He has no abdominal masses, tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. He has grossly intact musculoskeletal tone and strength with no dermatitis, ulcers or sores. He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with slightly depressed affect.\n\nAssessment and Plan:\n\n1. Ischemic right lower extremity consistent with thrombosed bypass graft. We will plan to admit the patient for treatment with intravenous heparin and plan to schedule him for an urgent arteriogram within the next 24 hours. We will attempt to identify any possible way to re-establish flow with either thrombolysis and\/or angioplasty and stenting. If this is unsuccessful, he will ultimately require redo fem-pop bypass graft.\n2. Tobacco abuse: The patient needs to continue to remain abstinent from smoking.\n3. Hypertension: Moderately controlled on current medications. His previous angiogram did not reveal any evidence of any hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. We will adjust him as appropriate from a medical standpoint.\n4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient's blood sugars are currently under good control on Glucophage, which we will need to hold post arteriogram. I will keep you informed as to the status of this very nice patient.\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in his management. If I can be of any further assistance and management of this or any of your patients with cerebrovascular, aortic, renovascular or low peripheral vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nShane R.

As you remember, he recently underwent a revision of his lower extremity bypass graft with thrombectomy of the fem-pop bypass graft and subsequent jump graft to the below-knee popliteal artery. He returns today for follow up evaluation.\n\nHe has a warm, well-perfused foot with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse. Unfortunately, over the last ten days he has developed increased erythema and tenderness on the medial aspect of his left knee with superficial skin breakdown consistent with either a staph or a strep cellulitis. He had been on a course of p.o. antibiotics over a week ago for treatment of strep throat as well. The patient has been increased his activity and prior to this time had been extremely active with no erythema, tenderness or drainage from his leg. My concern is that he has increased warmth with blanching and erythema on the medial aspect of his knee consistent with a superficial cellulitis and I believe that he would benefit from hospital admission with a course of IV antibiotics, bedrest and elevate. We will tentatively plan to admit him for localized wound care measures, treatment with IV Nafcillin on a q.4 hour basis. In addition, he has intact femoral pulses on the left side. He does report when he was ambulating he was having increased difficulty with claudication in the distal left lower extremity and calf region. Most recent vascular lab studies dated November 29, 2070 reveal an ABI of 0.96 on the right, 0.56 on the left.\n\nI will keep you informed as to the status of Mr. Xuereb. My concern is that if he does infect this PTFE graft we do not have any suitable autogenous conduit to perform an additional reconstruction and he would stand a very high chance of losing his limb at the knee level. If I can be of any further assistance in the management of this or any of your other patients with vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nShane R.

The wound bed was covered with yellow biofilm, which was debrided. The underlying wound bed contained moist red tissue with a few drops of bloody drainage. The margin was clear.\n\nIMPRESSION: There has been epithelialization of the wound along the medial aspect of the right knee. There has been no further disruption of the epithelium overlying the hypertrophic scar tissue.\n\nPLAN: We will continue with dressing changes every two to three days per the following protocol: spray the wound with AllClenz wound cleanser followed by irrigation with normal saline 30 cc x 3; apply skin protectant to the periwound margin, Panafil paste 1\/8 thick to the wound bed, gauze dampened with normal saline (cut-to-fit), covered with DuoDerm secured with Medipore tape.\n\nMr. Xuereb will return to clinic in two weeks.\n\n\nLillian Steele, N.P, Ph.D.\n\nDD:04\/27\/2071\nDT:04\/28\/2071\nFJ:801734 :77\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2073-12-03\n\n\nCCU JAR ADMIT NOTE\n\nName: Xuereb, Jaquante D\nMRN: 1344351\nDate of Admission: 12\/03\/73\nAdmitting Physician: Dr. Burke\nCode Status: Full\nSource of Hx: Chart, patient\n\nID\/CC: Chest pressure, pulmonary edema.\n\nHPI: 58 year old man with PMH HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, smoking.

Follow enzymes, heparinize both for ?ischemia and for PVD with sheath in place. As not lilely ACS, not emergent indication for cath, but he was scheduled for elective cath 12\/08 and likely would benefit from expedited diagnosis.\n\nPump - intubated, diruesis as allowed by pressure (JVP up, some edema of CXR). Started on peripheral dopa, but this is at least partially related to sedation.\n\nRhythm - Bradycardia, no acute issues\n\nIscenmia - Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI. Follow markers.

She has done relatively well in five weeks since surgery and her energy level has improved. The major ongoing symptoms is aching in the upper part of the sternum, and an opening in the lower part of the incision which drains some purulent material. She also has a suture and her leg which has worked its way to the surface and causes some discomfort. Her breathing is much better than preoperatively, and she has had no chest pain. She has very mild residual dyspnea. She has had mild edema at times, but it has largely resolved. She has had no fever.\n\nReview of Systems:.\nAll of the following are normal or negative. GENERAL: night sweats, fever and chills. HEAD AND NECK: headaches, hoarseness. RESPIRATORY: cough, coughing up blood. CARDIOVASCULAR: see history above. GASTROINTESTINAL: frequent heartburn or indigestion, difficulty swallowing, black or tarry stools, nausea\/vomiting. URINARY: frequent urination at night, urinary tract infections, blood in urine. NEUROLOGIC: transient paralysis, seizures, visual loss in one eye. HEMATOLOGIC: easy bruising. SKIN: new rashes or eruptions, poor healing of foot sores, moles that are changing size. ENDOCRINE: elevated blood sugars, thyroid problems. MUSCULOSKELETAL: low back pain, joint pains, joint swelling.\n\nFamily and Social History:\nFamily and social history have not changed. There is no pertinent new information which has bearing on the current problems.\n\nPhysical Examination:.\nShe looks quite well. Her blood pressure is 160\/80. Central venous pressure is normal and lungs are clear. There is mild tenderness with no redness or swelling over the upper end of the sternum, and there is a 1 cm in diameter opening of the incision at the lower end, with sero-purulent drainage. Lungs are clear. Heart shows regular rhythm and I hear no rub or murmur. Liver is not palpable and there is no edema. There was a small end of a suture from the small leg incision, which I clipped off.\n\nElectrocardiogram:.\nNormal sinus rhythm. Anterior T-wave inversion, somewhat to tracing. Before the operation.\n\nOverall, Mrs. Ulibarri is improved. I asked him concerns about possible smoldering infection of her sternum. I will send her to Trevino made to for the surgical team to violate this, and will then a CT scan of her chest and sternum looking for any collection of pus.\n\nI have encouraged her to continue to be active. Her walking is limited by pain, which limits or exercise. She has already returned to her part-time work.\n\nI made no change in her regimen today. Our plan to see her again a couple of months and she will continue on Coumadin anticoagulation. I'll keep you posted.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\nWilliam C.

He was treated with CHOP in 2066 followed by radiotherapy, completed in Nov 2066. He was free of disease since then until May 2073. He sought primary care for a URI and was noted to be anemic (HCT 31). His counts were followed and when his HCT dropped as low as 22 a Bone Marrow was done and showed myelodysplastic syndrome. He was considered for a allogenic stem-cell transplant. His major complaint is a dry cough that he has had since May 2073. It is provoked by eating, drinking and lying down. And only occasionally does he produce any sputum. He has been on numerous antibiotics in the past four months for the cough and he also developed a periorbital cellulitis for which he was hospitalized at Educare-Fargo for which he received a 3 week course of Ceftriaxone, Nafcillin and flagyl (finished at the end of July). In retrospect, he recognizes sinus pressure\/congestion associated with periorbital cellulitis. In August 2073 he had a questionable LLL PNA and was treated with cipro. On pre-transplant work-up, CXR revealed increase conspicuity of ill-defined LL zone opacity. CT chest reviewed today revealed mutlifocal pneumonia with associated radiation-related changes.\nThroughout this time period he has only had a few days of fever for which he was at KCGH and given abx and defervesced. He recalls nightsweats as the fevers broke. He does admit to maybe a 10 lb weight loss in the past 4 months. He denies SOB (unless he s severely anemic), orthopnea, sore throat, dysphagia, odynophagia, CP, palpitations, angina-like symptoms, acid-reflux, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, dysuria, frequency, nocturia, joint or muscle pain. He does have mild peripheral neuropathy in his feet bilaterally.\nPMH: MDS Peri-Orbital cellulitis, recent Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus Hypercholesterolemia Non-hodgkin s lymphoma (2066; tx w\/ CHOP and radiation) Pt: RPR neg, CMV neg, HSV pos, TOXO pos, EBV pos, VZV pos, Hep Panel neg, HTLV neg and HIV neg, PPD neg 9\/20\/73 and 8\/7\/73 Donor: RPR neg, CMV neg, Hep Panel neg, HIV neg, HTLV neg, PPD neg (traveled to Saudi Arabia, Cartersville, Newport)\nMedications on admission: Cipro (last dose 9\/18\/73) Lantus and novolog Procrit Zetia, ASA, VitB\/MVI\nInpatient medication: Antimicrobials\/immune booster: Acyclovir Bactrim (to d\/c day 0) Levaquin (to start day 1) GCSF (start d+1) Immunosuppressants: Fludarabine, Vusulfan Tacrolimus (start day 3) Rapamycin (start day 3) Other: zoran, ativan\/compazine, mvi\/folate, ompeprazole, lantus, novolog, metformin, Demerol, oxycodone\nAllergies: NKDA\nSocial History: He is a programmer and works as a Industrial Engineering and Manufacturing Technologist at Activision Blizzard.

Paramediastinal opacification is changed. Cardiomediastinal silhoutte is stable. Nodular opacity in the left perihilar region appears less apparent. No new consolidations are seen. There is a new left-sided Hickman catheter with its tip in the SVC. No pneumothorax is seen. Impression: 66 yo M with h\/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology.\nThe differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and non-infectious diagnoses. Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease, such as COP. However, we also think that several infectious etiologies should be considered. Endemic mycoses (histo, blasto and crypto), cryptococcal pneumonia, nocardiasis, aspergillus, mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient. While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease, the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers, progressive weight loss and systemic illness argues against this diagnosis.\nI (AYX) have interviewed and examined Mr. Ware, and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note. My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process, such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOP\/COP. An occult infection is quite possible, such as pulmonary MAC or a mold (the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious). Clinically he is unchanged over many months, so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated.\nWe recommend the following work-up:\n-Expectorated sputum for gram stain and culture -Induced sputum for -PCP -Modified AFB smear (looking for Nocardia) -Fungal stain and culture -Urine histo antigen -Serum cryptococcal antigen -Weekly monitoring of galactomannan and D-glucan -Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral panel (RSV, Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, paraflu A and B) and viral culture\nIf the above work-up is unrevealing, please consult pulmonology for a bronchoscopy -- sooner rather than later.\nIt is reasonable to start is levaquin 500 mg QD now to treat empirically for typical and atypical pathogens (this medication is scheduled to begin in two days, per protocol).\nOur recommendations were communicated to Dr. Dalton and Dr. Robin Jeffery of the patient s primary team. Thank you for this consult. Our team will follow with you\n\n\nTina Isaiah-Villagomez, MD; Fellow Alexander Y.

The\npatient denies chest pain, palpitations, or syncope but does\ncomplain of bilateral lower extremity edema times several weeks.\nThe patient has been worked up for the symptoms as an outpatient\nand placed on Lasix for the past 2 weeks and had an\nechocardiogram today, which was remarkable for atrial\nfibrillation. The patient was sent to the Emergency Department\nfor further evaluation. Please see the written record for\nfurther details.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin-dependent diabetes,\nmyelodysplastic syndrome, status post stem cell transplant.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Basal cell resection.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies smoking, alcohol, or illicit\ndrug use.\nMEDICATIONS: Lasix, vitamin D, Lantus, and acyclovir.\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: I have examined the patient and agree with\nthe physical as documented. Of note, the patient is awake and\nalert, in no acute distress. Vitals: Temperature is 96.9, pulse\nis 100 to 128, respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure is 118\/70,\nand oxygen saturation is 96%. Lungs: Clear bilaterally with no\nrales, rhonchi, or wheezing. Cardiovascular exam: Irregularly\nirregular rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs. Abdomen: Soft\nwith no tenderness, guarding, or rebound. Extremity exam: The\npatient has bilateral lower extremity 2+ pitting edema, left\ngreater than right. No calf tenderness.\nMEDICAL DECISION MAKING AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: Mr.\nWare is a 67-year-old man with diabetes and a 2-week history of\nincreasing dyspnea on exertion. His chest x-ray did not\ndemonstrate pulmonary edema, but was significant for bilateral\npleural effusions. The patient's EKG demonstrated a flutter with\na ventricular rate of 121 with inferolateral T-wave inversions.\nThe patient was given IV and p.o. Cardizem with control of the\nventricular rate. At the time of this dictation, the patient's\nlaboratory data are not available. The plan is to admit the\npatient to the hospital for further management.\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: New onset AFib.\nDISPOSITION: Admission.\nCONDITION UPON ADMISSION: Good.\n\nVILLA, SCOTT M.D.\nD: 12\/21\/74\nT: 12\/21\/74\nDictated By: VILLA, SCOTT\neScription document:7-5753770 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2075-03-03\n\nID CONSULT NOTE\nPATIENT NAME: Vincent Ware MRN: 98044905\nDATE OF ADMISSION: 3\/02\/75 DATE OF CONSULT: 3\/03\/75 ID ATTENDING: Haney\nID FELLOW: Riddle\nSERVICE ATTENDING: Vann REASON FOR CONSULT: Cough, dyspnea, fevers s\/p HSCT off immune suppression\nHPI:\nMr. Ware is a 67-year-old man with a history non-Hodgkins's lymphoma (spinal mass, s\/p CHOP, radiation, in long term remission) and secondary MDS s\/p reduced intensity allo-HSCT 12\/73. His post-tx course was unremarkable. Peritransplant he devloped a multifocal PNA of unclear etiology. Pretransplant imaging showed peribronchial thickening, and post transplant a tree & bud appearance with more focal areas of consolidation. Per the patient, he had a dry hacking cough with occaisional fevers and night sweats that lasted from April through November of 73 and resolved on their own. He had several courses of quinolones (and other abx) during this period without significant relief, but ultimately his symptoms improved on their own. His immune suppression was d\/c'd 7\/74. He deveoloped iron overload (Ferritin 1356) and started phlebotomy 9\/74.\nMr. Ware did well from a respiratory standpoint until 11\/74 when he noticed intermittent fevers approximately every 2 weeks. At first they were in the 99 range and they would last 1-2days and be associated with malaise. He also again experienced symptoms of a dry hacking cough that occurs with change in positioning (not necessarily lying flat). By the end of November, the fevers were a bit higher (100.5). He saw his PCP who thought he might have PNA. He obtained a CXR and gave hime a course ofr azithromycin (5d). His fevers improved. In early December, he began experienceing SOB with exertional dyspnea. He saw his PCP again who rx avelox. He got another CXR which showed some fluid and was strated on lasix. He was also referred for echocardiogram, PFTs, and chest CT. On arrival, he was found to be in AFB w\/RVR.\nHe was admitted from 12\/21-01\/02. He was rate controlled and had minimal diuresis. Cardiac MRI suggested constrictive pericarditis and possible areas of active pericarditis. Right & left heart cath which showed no evidence of cosntriction hemodynamically. He had 1 temperature to 101.4, and given his history he was seen by our service. Blood cultures were negative. Induced sputum was negative for AFB x 3. He and influenza\/rsv\/paraflu\/adnevorus nasal swabs which were also negative. Sputum cultures grew oral flora. CMV VL, glucan, and galactomannan were also negative.\nHe improved w\/regard to SOB but cough persisted. He was seen by Dr. Vann who was concerned for an immunologic process given his bilateral pleural effusions & question of pericarditis. He had a URI syndrome in January that lasted 3 weeks then resolved. On February 19th, he noticed the onset of low-grade temps (100.0-100.5) with malaise and mild chills. These happened nightly through. He saw his PCP 2\/23 who rx moxifloxacin. He had no change in his symptoms. He had some mild rhinorrhea and mildly increased SOB. He denies CP, abdominal pain, HA, N\/V\/D, joint pain, skin rashes, dysuria. His son had a head cold prior to the onset of his symptoms. No other sick contacts.

He also had VRE\/klebsiella LUQ abscess s\/p IR drainage.\nHe was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome, but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin. So he was switched to vanco\/ambisome\/linezolid\/meropenem\/amikacin for LUQ abscess. After 6 weeks of high-dose ambisome, he was taken back to OR on 7\/31 for re-exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophageal-jejunostomy site that surgeons scooped out as much as they could, but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions. Given the inability to completely en-bloc resect Mr. Ethridge's GI mucor despite a long-trial of Ambisome, he was started on an investigational drug, posaconazole, provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis. This has had 50% success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials.

Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea, although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects. On balance, if his labs are ok, I'd favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings. ECG without QTc prolongation. Abdomen is bening.

The patient was doing well until a few days prior to admission when he noticed a swelling in his new graft and a decrease in the degree of its pulse. Then on the morning of admission when he noticed his graft was without a palpable pulse or thrill. The patient then presented to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ER for evaluation and treatment.\n\nIn the ER, the patient was found to have an engorged AV graft without dopplerable pulse or bruit. The patient was seen by surgery and an ultrasound of the upper extremity revealed a clotted graft and so the patient was admitted to the medical service for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nOf note, the patient denies any pain \/ numbness \/ coolness in his hand. He further denies any shortness of breath, increased swelling in his legs, or changes in his weight. He does indicate that he has suffered from decreased oral intake lately secondary to feeling tired and having a decreased appetite.\n\nPMH: Diabetes mellitus\nDiabetic neuropathy\nHypertension\nChronic renal disease - secondary to diabetes & hypertension, baseline Cr 4\nAnemia - baseline hematocrit mid 30s\nGastrointestinal mucormycosis - s\/p GI surgery (see below)\n\nPSH: Hip replacement\nTotal gastrectomy, gastroesophagojejunostomy, distal pancreatectomy, transverse colectomy\nSplenectomy\nLeft total hip replacement\n\nAllergies: Nafcillin - rash\n\nSH: Patient lives in Kemmerer at the Chestnut Lodge Sanitarium.

The patient has a history of multiple problems with access (clots, stenoses), requiring frequent thrombectomies and revisions. The patient first noticed a problem on July 23, and by the 24th he said that the access had collapsed. On July 25, interventional radiology attempted to thrombectomize the clot, with no success, requiring placement of a new tunneled catheter in left IJ to allow dialysis. At present, patient is on the OR waiting list for tomorrow, for thrombectomy\/revision.\n\nOf note, patient was admitted in April of 2064 after a nurse at the McLaren Hospital detected a new cardiac murmur.

Apparently he has had guaiac positive stools and has undergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyps. Three have been removed and he then had a GI bleed. This has been reevaluated and he has been stable. The fourth polyp will need to be removed at a later time. At this point, his aspirin has been discontinued for a number of days and the Lopid was also discontinued apparently because of increased liver function tests. His current medications therefore include Lasix 40 mg per day, Metoprolol 25 mg qd, Nifedipine XL 30 mg qd. He is aware of a belching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no exertional or other related symptoms. He is reasonably active but somewhat limited by his claudication. On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 130\/70, a heart rate of 65 and regular. Head and neck were unremarkable. Chest is clear. Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distension at 30 degrees. PMI is normal. S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split. There is an S4 and a I\/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border. Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis. His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and a nonspecific left intraventricular conduction delay. Jacob Bautista, M.D. Re: Umstead, Kenneth July 04, 2073 Page 2 I think Mr. Umstead is basically doing quite well. It would be of value to repeat an exercise test since he has not had one since 2069. He had minimal ischemia at that time. There are no symptoms that would prompt cardiac catheterization at this point and we will see how he does on the exercise test with the objective findings. If any problems develop, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you very much for allowing me to help with his care. Kindest personal regards. Sincerely yours, Marshall O.

He feels his legs are better and that he can walk greater distances. He feels very comfortable. His current medications include Metoprolol 50 mg per day, Nifedipine XL 60 mg per day, Lasix 20 mg per day. On exam today, he has a blood pressure of 146\/76, a heart rate of 65 and regular. Weight 210 pounds. Head and neck unremarkable. Chest is clear. Cardiac exam is notable for an S4 and a I\/VI systolic ejection murmur. The rest of his exam was unremarkable. Resting 12 lead electrocardiogram is unchanged demonstrating normal sinus rhythm and a left axis deviation. There is a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay. I think Mr. Umstead is doing very well. He would like to have his arterial pulses rechecked noninvasively and I tried to arrange that schedule. In addition, his Metoprolol has been only once a day and if he can tolerate it twice a day he will have a better control and more prolonged risk prevention. I suggest that we increase it to 50 mg bid. I also told him how to take his pulse and he can keep an eye on it. If it drops too low we can reduce the dose. He asked that I see him again in about six months for routine re-evaluation and I will be happy to do so. If any problems develop in the interim please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you for allowing me to help with his care. Kindest regards. Kenneth Umstead MR #401-10-87-8 -2- December 19, 2073 Sincerely yours, Marshall O.

His primary limitation had been his claudication, but he feels that he can walk better now than in the past. We had a repeat evaluation of his segmental leg pressure and volumes, and these actually were unchanged from a prior study two years ago. The post volume recordings were normal in each leg. Systolic pressure gradients were present in the right leg consistent with mild anterior tibial\/dorsalis pedis disease. No systolic pressure gradients were found in the left leg. These were unchanged from January, 2072. Mr. Umstead feels that he can be more physically active and is less limited. His current medical regimen includes Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d, Nifedipine XL 60 mg q.d, and Lasix 20 mg q.d. Of note, in October, 2073, he was found by colonoscopy to have four polyps which were removed. Apparently, no malignant cells were seen in the pathologic specimens. On exam, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 122\/68, heart rate 63 and regular, weight 205 lbs. HEENT unremarkable. Chest was clear. Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees, PMI is normal. S1 and S2 normal but physiologically split. There was an S4 and a I\/VI systolic ejection murmur at the lower left sternal border. Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis. His resting 12 lead EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, and persisting X waves across the precordium consistent with his left anterior hemiblock. I think Mr. Umstead is doing quite well. He asked that I see him again in six months for routine re-evaluation, and I would be happy to do so. If any problems develop in the interim please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care. Kenneth Umstead MR# 401-10-87-8 -2- Jun 04, 2074 With best regards.

He developed gait instability and began confusing family members with each other, and being confused about whether the house he was in was his own. This increased in severity over the past 3-4 days. He complains of some weakness in his left leg but otherwise has had no other focal motor or sensory deficits. He has had no recent fevers, chills, SOB, sudden motor or sensory loss. No new incontinence.\nThis history was limited by patient s inability to cooperate.\nED COURSE: Tox screen and metabolic workup in ED were both negative. CXR and U\/A performed showing no infectious processes. Head CT was performed showing no change from prior, though there was a small increase in the size of the lateral ventricles possibly suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus. LP was negative. Pt was admitted to Internal Medicine for further workup of recent change in mental status and neuro\/psych consult.\nMEDICAL HISTORY Cerebellar stroke: 1\/82. Coumadin d\/c'd 8\/82, Aggrenox started.

Mild progression of periventricular and deep white matter T2 hyperintensity which is nonspecific, likely relating to progression of small vessel ischemic disease.

Mildly increased prominence of the lateral ventricles with increased periventricular hypoattenuation. Although this likely represents microangiopathic changes with commensurate ventricular prominence, consider normal pressure hydrocephalus in the correct clinical setting.\nEKG: Sinus rhythm, 1st degree AV block with atrial bigemeny. Left axis deviation and LVH by R in aVL >11.\nASSESSMENT & PLAN 87yo M with h\/o Alzheimer s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s\/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations. The etiology of this downturn remains unclear. Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U\/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely. Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results. However, microembolic disease may be a possibility. Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted. As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely. LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH. One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.\nA more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient. Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly. However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning.\nDementia: CXR, U\/A negative. CT\/MRI negative for acute embolic events. Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer s dementia. will d\/w attending consider psychiatric consult Continue Namenda for presumed Alzheimer s Will consult neuro for management of Alzheimer s and further workup of possible NPH\nH\/o cerebellar stroke: Currently on Aggrenox (not on Coumadin due to fall risk), will continue.\nNIDDM: Will start RISS\nHyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor 20mg PO QD\nHTN: metoprolol\nProphylaxis: already on Aggrenox for embolic ppx.\nCode Status: Will need to discuss with wife tomorrow.\n\n\nJacob V Ure, MD Pager # 02664\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2088-06-28\nReason for Visit\nComprehensive physical exam and ongoing management of multiple medical problems.\n\nProblems\nCongestive heart failure\nHe had admission to MCH 9\/87 with CHF. He was started on Carvedilol and Spironolactone during that visit. He was aggressively diuresed with marked improvement in his symptoms. Beta blocker was reduced during that admission as well. Most recent echo from 5\/02\/88 showed severely depressed LV systolic function, EF 30%, global hypokinesis with antero-apical akinesis. Moderate LV margin. Mild concentric LVH and mild L atrial enlargement (41 mm.). Dilated aortic loop. Normal RV size and function. Mild aortic insufficiency and trace MR.\n\nHe is now doing exceedingly well on his current regimen and denies any symptoms of SOB, orthopnea or pedal edema. He continues to be followed regularly by regularly by Dr. Cook for his ischemic cardiomyopathy\/CHF.\ncoronary artery disease\nAfter his admission for CHF, he underwent dolbutamine stress test on 9\/30\/87, which revealed a small area of ischemia in mid-anterior and a moderate to large-sized area of ischemia inferiorly and there was moderate LV dilatation following stress. Based on this, he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization. 10\/87 he underwent stenting X4 of L circumflex coronary artery and third obtuse marginal branch. Notably, his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded proximately and was collateralized from the LAD, which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery. The L main had no significant lesions. The LAD had a 50% lesion just before the first diagonal and the mid-LAD was occluded.\n\nHe had successful stenting with very good angiographic results and he received adjuvant intravenous [ ] therapy. He was discharged the following day without complications. Although his current activity level is somewhat limited by his DJD (see below), he is exercising regularly in the pool and he currently denies any symptoms of angina.\npacemaker\nS\/P DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome 7\/83 and doing well. Continues follow-up with Dr. Whitlock\/Cook.\nS\/P CARDIAC ARREST\n12\/76. 10\/76 DEVELOPED EXERTIONAL ANGINA, POSITIVE ETT. CATH AT NEDH REVEALED THREE-VESSEL CAD. AWAITING CABG WHEN 12\/76 SUFFERED CARDIAC ARREST. FOUND TO BE IN VT, HAD RECURRENT VT. TRANSFERRED TO MCH AND UNDERWENT CABG AND AICD 2\/77.

If it remains elevated, would consider increasing Carvedilol\ndiabetes mellitus\nHe continues on Glyburide and although he checks fasting sugars infrequently, they are typically in the 120's and he denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia. He has not seen a podiatrist regularly and I have encouraged him to begin this process. Will check FBS, HBA1C and urine for microalbumin today.\nhypercholesterolemia\nHe has had virtual normalization of his lipid profile with Lipitor. We will check fasting lipids and LFT's today.\nnephropathy\nS\/P renal biopsy 10\/79 for severe proteinuria which was consistent with diabetic nephropathy. As noted above, a 24-hour urine recently revealed 6gm of protein. He is on new maximal doses of ACEI's. [02-Jun-2087]\n\nRecheck BUN and creatinine today.\nperipheral vascular disease\nHe has bilateral femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses, but because of his limited walking ability, currently has no symptoms of claudication.\nRECTAL FISTULA\nSINCE LAST VISIT HE WAS SEEN BY DR. JENSON AND UNDERWENT A FLEXIBLE. SIG. HE HAD A SINUS OPENING IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR PERIANAL AREA. HE FELT THAT TO FULLY EVALUATE THIS TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS AN ANAL FISTULA OR A PILONIDAL CYST THAT EXAM UNDER ANESTHESIA WITH UNROOFING OF THE LESION WAS INDICATED. PT SO FAR HAS DECLINED THIS, BUT WILL LET DR. JENSON KNOW IF HE RECONSIDERS. CURRENTLY HE IS WILLING TO LIVE WITH HIS SYMPTOMS.\nOSTEOARTHRITIS\nHe has had recent significant worsening in his L knee pain. It has now gotten to the point where it limits his ability to walk, so that he can only limp less than a block and has difficulty with stairs. Given that he has done well from a cardiac standpoint since his admissions in the spring, he is interested in pursuing a L TKR replacement if Cardiology feels it would be feasible. Will refer him to Dr. Robles for initial evaluation.\nCarotid stenosis\nAccording to Dr. Cook's records, a carotid artery duplex scan from 5\/06 showed 60 to 80% stenosis of the RICA, but I do not find those records of PCIS. Apparently he is scheduled for a repeat study before he follows up with Dr. Cook. He is S\/P R cerebellar CVA back in '80 and has had stable minor neurologic deficits since that time and currently denies any new neurologic symptoms.\n\nReview of Systems\nSmall lesion on his R ear. Recent R groin infection which required treatment with antiobiotics by Dr. Valentine in 5\/06. Nocturia X1. Denies symptoms of hypoglycemia. No neurologic symptoms. Denies palpitations, SOB, chest pain, lightheadedness or syncope. Denies peripheral edema. No abdominal pain or change in his bowels. He does have chronic rectal fistula and continues to have intermittent hematochezia and discharge, but he is able to self-treat this and declines surgery. No melena.\n\nVital Signs\nWeight: 188 Pounds\nBlood Pressure: 140\/60\nPulse: 64 Regular\n\nPhysical Exam\n\nGeneral Appearance\nWell appearing.\nSkin\nExtensive sun damage, with several actinic-appearing lesions over scalp, forehead and pinna.

Wife very helpful in cooking appropriate meals and helping with day to day issues.\nONGOING MANAGEMENT\/MULTIPLE MEDICAL PROBLEMS: 1. Health maintenance. Eye exam. Continue to recommend annual exams with Dr. Ortiz. Influenza vaccine advised, Winter 89. PSA sent. 2. Preventative counseling. Continues to swim in a pool, no alcohol, no cigarettes. Advised regular skin checks. Avoidance of sun. Rectal exam neg. Smoking status: none smoker. Stool guaiac test: home with stool guaiac cards.\nPROBLEMS: 1. CAD. He continues to do quite well with no evidence of current symptoms of angina. He is s\/p CABG and most recently s\/p stent distal LCX 10\/87. 2. CHF. He has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic CHF. His most recent echocardiogram 4\/88, showed a severe depressed LV systolic function with estimated EF of 30% with global hypokinesis and antero-apical akinesis with moderate LV enlargement and mild concentric LVH with left atrial enlargement, dilated aortic root, mild AI and trace MR. despite this, since getting on a stable dose of Lasix and Carvedilol, which was added during his hospitalization for CHF in 10\/87, he has done well and currently denies symptoms of orthopnea, PND or edema. 3. S\/P AICD. He is s\/p recent admission to MCH, 6\/17 through 6\/19\/89 for replacement of his cardiac defibrillator. He did well without complication and he continues to follow up Dr. Cook on a regular basis. He has had no VT, VF, which has been symptomatic or which has caused triggering of his AICD. 4. S\/P DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome, 7\/83. Continues to do well, again, with close monitoring by Dr. Cook. 5. Hypertension. Blood pressure is excellent on current regimen and will continue same.\nGeorge, Rickey MR #113-14-14 -2- June 27, 2089\n6. Diabetes mellitus. He continues on oral agents, watching his diet and exercising as much as he is able. He does not monitor sugars often but he reports when he does have them done, sugars are typically fasting 100-150 and no symptoms of hypoglycemia. Will check HBA1C and urine for micro albumin today. 7. Cerebral vascular disease. He is s\/p cerebellar CVA, 7\/80 with mild residual dysarthria and right sided weakness but has had no new neurologic events. His most recent carotid artery duplex study was from 5\/88, showed a 60-80% stenosis of the RICA but I don't actually hear a bruit on his exam today. He continues on Coumadin anticoagulation. 8. Hypercholesterolemia. His most recent lipid profile is quite improved with Lipitor with a total cholesterol down to 136, triglycerides 313, HDL 25, LDL 48 on 6\/11\/89. Unfortunately, since his HDL remains low, which is suboptimal, but he has not tolerated Niacin in the past. 9. Peripheral vascular disease. He continues to have bilateral femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses but because of his limited walking ability, he currently has no symptoms of claudication. 10. Osteoarthritis. He is s\/p left TKR by Dr. Robles last year and is now doing quite well. Notably, he would require antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain. He continues to have a rectal fistula. Last year, had a negative Barium enema study and several years ago a sigmoidoscopy because of guaiac positive stool but this is presumably secondary to the rectal fistula, which intermittently bleeds. He has had no recent edema in his legs. His left knee is doing quite well and he is working to strengthen the thigh muscles. He has nocturia one time per night. He has stable impotence, some decreased interest as well as some decreased ability to have erections, though he can still have a partial erection. Generalized decreased energy level.\nPHYSICAL EXAM: Blood pressure: 136\/60, pulse: 60 and regular. Weight: 181. General: amazingly well appearing. Skin: no suspicious lesions.

No recent symptoms of angina though he apparently was started on Imdur during a hospitalization in West Virginia this spring.\n2. Status post VF arrest. Status post AICD. Continues to follow up with Dr. Cook on a regular basis. AICD has not triggered.\n3. Status post DDD pacer for sic sinus syndrome. He has frequent ectopics versus? AF by exam today. Will check EKG and rhythm strip.\n4. CHF\/CMCAD. He had an episode of shortness of breath leading to hospitalization this spring down in West Virginia. Unfortunately, I do not have records but there was some question of whether this was related to asthma, allergies or CHF. He has had two pillow orthopnea and worsening edema than in the past. He has also noted some more exertional dyspnea. He denies cough, wheeze, hemoptysis? PND.\nMost recent echo 4\/88, severely depressed LV with EF about 30%. Mild concentric LVH. Dilated aortic route. Mild AI. Trace MR. He is currently on a regimen of Imdur, Lasix, Carvedilol, Zestril and Digoxin.\nWill plan increase Lasix to 80 q.d. Check chest x-ray, PFTs and reassess. George, Rickey MR#: 1131414 July 7, 2090 Page 2\n5. Diabetes mellitus. Continues on oral agents and has been quite good with his diet. Weight is actually down 10 pounds which he attributes to excellent attention to diet. Will recheck FBS, HB A1c today. He continues to receive routine dental and podiatry care.\n6. Status post cerebellar CVA. Mild residual dysarthria and right sided weakness. No new neurologic events. Most recent carotid study 5\/88, 60-80% stenosis right internal carotid. He continues on Coumadin.\n7. Hyperlipidemia. Continues on Lipitor with improved lipid profile though HDL remains low. He has not tolerated Niacin in the past. Will recheck fasting lipids today.\n8. Peripheral vascular disease. Continues to have bilateral femoral bruits but no complaints of claudication.\n9. Osteoarthritis\/left knee pain. He is status post left TKR by Dr. Robles last year. Unfortunately had a knee injury down in West Virginia this spring and has quite a bit of problem with swelling and pain. He was seen by Dr. Robles who treated him briefly with Vioxx but this caused significant worsening lower extremity edema and decreased urine output requiring its discontinuation. He is now carefully using ibuprofen and has follow up scheduled with Dr. Robles.\n10. Nephropathy. Status post renal biopsy 10\/79 for severe proteinuria. Biopsy consistent with diabetic nephropathy. Continues on ACE inhibitor. Will recheck BUN, creatinine today.\nReview of systems: As per HPI, no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia, hematuria. Otherwise as noted above.\nPhysical examination: Weight 175 (down from 181 6\/89). Pulse 64? frequent ectopic beats versus irregularly irregular rhythm. Blood pressure 130\/70.

Status post removal of infected AICD and pacer. Admitted to Massillon Community 12\/91 with infection of his AICD and permanent pacer. He was managed by multiple services including EP, Cardiology, and ID. His OR cultures grew candida and he was treated with a prolonged course of fluconazole. Although he had runs of NSVT, he was managed effectively with carvedilol. Notably his digoxin was stopped because of bradycardia during the hospitalization. He never had any sustained VT or VF. He was subsequently discharged home with a Life vest defibrillator.\nHe has done well with no recurrent evidence of infection. He currently has no AICD or pacemaker but saw Dr. Cook yesterday and apparently he is being evaluated for new hardware for his arrhythmia issues. He has a history of both VF arrest and sick sinus syndrome. Currently his heart rate is slightly irregular but a reasonable rate and he will continue on his current regimen as prescribed by Dr. Cook with close follow up.\n2. CHF. Immediately after his discharge from CCGH after his hospitalization, he went directly to West Virginia where his wife was able to care for him. He had one episode of CHF, which was managed as an outpatient, and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously. At the present time, he has no active symptoms of CHF, he continues to sleep on two large pillows at night without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema. He does continue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix.\n3. Coronary artery disease. Despite all of his active issues, he has no current symptoms of angina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well.\n4. Status post infected (staph) left knee arthroplasty. His left TKR also required removal due to infection and he had replacement of new hardware by Dr. Judd 10\/91. He has had no recurrent infection, but his rehabilitation has been more limited because of his other medical issues. He does report that he was swimming in the pool and doing things on his own while down in West Virginia, but we will make a formal rehab referral now that he is back in the Mexico area.\n5. Diabetes mellitus. Throughout his numerous medical problems over the past six to twelve months, he has had a significant weight loss and not surprisingly, his diabetes regimen has been gradually decreased. He is now on Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. and he reports that his fasting sugars which he is checking about three times a week are running quite good in the 100 to 120 range. He has no complaints of hypoglycemia or blood sugars greater than 200. We will check his HbA1c today and continue his current regimen. George, Rickey MRN: 1131414 06\/10\/92 Page 2\n6. Hyperlipidemia. He continues on Lipitor. We'll recheck his fasting lipids, LFTs and CPK.\n7. Diabetic nephropathy. He remains on ACE inhibitor and will check renal function today to re-establish baseline.\n8. Status post CVA. Known moderate right carotid stenosis. Minimal residual dysarthria and right-sided weakness. Has had no recent neurologic symptoms and remains on Coumadin.\nPHYSICAL EXAM: Blood pressure by palpation 130. Was unable to get sufficient blood pressure by cuff. Pulse 60, mostly irregular. General, thin, but no distress. Lungs, clear to auscultation and percussion. Cor, distant heart sounds. No S3 appreciated. Old pacer\/AICD site. No evidence of erythema or fluctuance. Extremities, trace edema bilaterally.\nDISPOSITION: Close ongoing follow up.\nADDENDUM: In reviewing patient's medical records after he left today, I found mention of both hematuria and guaiac positive stool during his recent hospitalizations. At this time, he was quite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy. He did deny abdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today.\nAt this point, my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and send in to me by mail. I have also sent off a CBC today. I will plan to repeat urinalysis at his next visit. If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool, then we will need to discuss more aggressive work-up, but given his overall health condition, I do not feel the need to be aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first.\n\nOpal C.

PROBLEMS: PVD: since last visit he was admitted to MCH with gangrene in his left second toe. Admitted MCH 8\/29 through 9\/9\/92. Treated by Dr. Randall. Underwent extensive revascularization including right common and external artery transluminal balloon angioplasty and stenting, bilateral common and profunda femoral artery endarterectomies, right and left femoral to femoral bypass graft, left femoral to above knee popliteal bypass graft. With this surgery, only his left second toe remained gangrenous and he was able to avoid BKA. He will likely either auto-amputate or will require amputation of his left second toe which remains gangrenous but he has reasonable perfusion to the remainder of his left foot and has follow up scheduled next week with Dr. Randall. Renal insufficiency: during his hospitalization he bumped his creatinine quite a bit but this appeared to be due to acute interstitial nephritis caused by Unasyn (positive urine EO's), reached a high of 3.9 on 9\/02 but was down to 1.4 which is baseline at the time of hospital discharge 9\/9. Will recheck renal function today. Diabetes mellitus: his appetite has been poor and he had blood sugars, which were low on oral agents, and these have been discontinued. His blood sugars are now in the normal range on no oral agents or insulin. Will need to monitor closely through rehab. CHF: he had been on 80 b.i.d. of Lasix prior to his hospitalization. At the time of hospital discharge his dose was down to 40 b.i.d. and not surprisingly he developed quite a bit of recurrent peripheral edema. He called the office and I increased his Lasix back up to 60 b.i.d. but he still has significant edema. Will go back to 80 b.i.d. with close monitoring. Hypertension: with diuresis and weight loss, his BP is running low. Will hold lisinopril for now. Close VNA follow up. COPD: doing well despite recent surgery. Continues to use Combivent inhaler p.r.n. Anemia: Crit was in the 20's during his hospitalization in the setting of acute renal failure and surgery with blood loss. His Crit at the time of discharge was approximately 28.7 and he was being started on Epogen. Unfortunately because of insurance issues, he has not actually been able to yet obtain it but the plan is for him to get 2,000 units 3 times a Rickey George MR#1131414 October 05, 2092 Page 2 week. For now, he is on vitamins and iron supplements as his bowels tolerate. Given his history of CAD, goal is to keep his hematocrit between 30-32. Coronary artery disease: despite his recent surgical stress and anemia, he has had no anginal symptoms. Review of systems: constipation related to the iron. Generally weak. Home services now include VNA, home health aide, PTOT, walking with a walker, biggest issue is mostly depression in the setting of his failing health. Social history: wife very involved with his care. Physical exam: BP 98\/60. Pulse 64. Lungs clear to A & P. Cor: SEMACIAN gallop. No rub. Abdomen: mildly distended, nontender. Multiple well healed surgical scars. Extremities: incisions in the groin. No erythema. Right groin several cm question cystic structure beneath the incision. Soft, nontender, non-erythematous. 2-3+ edema in the extremities bilaterally. Dry gangrene left second toe. Disposition: 1. Increase Lasix to 80 b.i.d. phone follow up within several days. 2. Temporarily hold lisinopril given low BP. 3. Continue Percocet for toe pain. 4. Follow up with Dr. Randall who needs to assess the cystic mass in his right groin. 5. Will continue to work with insurance to try to obtain Epogen. In the meantime, will transfuse if Crit drops below 28. 6. Add Lexapro 10mg 1 p.o. q.d. Addendum: long discussion with the patient and his wife (his healthcare proxy) today about end of life issues. Specifically he states he would never consider any amputation other than his single toe at this point. He would specifically rather die than undergo a BKA. He also states he wishes to be DNR and would not consider intubation even under the circumstances of acute CHF or pneumonia.

Her Sjogren's has been reasonably stable. She still remains with difficulty in controlling her blood sugar. She has continued difficulty with her oral cavity. She has had no extraglandular symptoms -- specifically, polyneuropathy, myopathy, or purpura.\nShe uses artificial tears and saliva. She remains on insulin and estrogens.\nShe has a one-week history of pain and swelling of her left wrist. She was seen at the Graduate Hospital Emergency Room several days ago. Radiographs of the wrist show chondrocalcinosis. She was started on Motrin with some response but still has active symptoms. She is wearing a splint.\nToday on exam, she is afebrile. There was OA involving the DIP joints. PIPs and MCPs were nontender. The left wrist showed swelling and heat with diminished motion. Right wrist showed full range of motion. Elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and feet did not show active synovitis. There was no adenopathy and lungs were clear.\nI aspirated the left wrist under sterile technique. No fluid was obtained. I injected it with 40 mg of Depo-Medrol.\nClinically, I think she has had pseudogout. She has chondrocalcinosis on radiograph and has a clinical picture consistent with crystal disease. In addition, she has primary Sjogren's. The two diseases are unrelated.\nIn addition to injection of her wrist, I switched her from Motrin to Celebrex 200 mg twice a day due to side effect profile issues. She should probably take that for about five to seven days. Side effects were reviewed.\nI would like to see her back in four months. She will be returning to you for further care in the interim.\n\nFrank Ito, M.D. RE: Rivers, Ida MRN: 71701456 Page 2\nADDENDUM: At her next visit, I will want her to check her calcium and thyroid status since that can be associated with CPPD disease.\nWith best wishes,\nRichard F.

She noted that she was not feeling well throughout the morning, and she felt as if she may need to eat something. However, because she did not have her insulin and blood sugar monitoring equipment, she decided not to eat. She continued to feel poorly (she is somewhat vague on symptoms but reports feeling that her chest was congested and that she may have had some palpitations and felt chilled). She saw a police cruiser, and walked over to it with the intention of getting help. When she arrived, there was no one in the car, and she leaned forward to rest her head on the front of the car. This is the last thing she remembered; when she awoke, she was surrounded by people. She was told that she had falled backwards and hit the back of her head. When EMS found her, she was confused, making repetitive statements, and stating that she had pain in her occiput that radiated down her neck. When she arrived at the FMH ED, her blood pressure was 213\/97 HR 84 RR20 O2 sat 99% RA Temp 97.3. She received Labetolol 20 iv, Toradol 30 mg iv, ASA 325 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg po x 1. Her mental status cleared somewhat, and her blood pressure came down to 130s\/80s. She did have one episode of emesis, during which her HR was noted to transiently dip to the 40s (not captured on the monitor); spontaneously recovered to the 60s.\nShe had a C-spine series and head CT which were negative for acute process, and a CXR which was negative except for R shoulder not well-visualized on CXR. She was noted to have some superficial bleeding of her posterior scalp, but no obvious laceration. She was admitted to the SDU because of the episode of bradycardia.\n\nPMH\/PSH\n-Diabetes Type I (by her report) followed at Hometown Medical\n-Sjogren's disease, followed by Dr Vidal at RGH\n-Pseudogout\n-s\/p benign breast mass resection 11 yrs ago.\n-?

She has an extensive vascular history s\/p right popliteal PTA\/Stent and left common femoral endarterectomy for which she has been receiving regular care from Dr. Nichols. She has a history of mixed connective tissue disease with Raynaud's for which she has been followed by Dr. Lucille Jackson.\nShe reports that for the past year she has had dyspnea on exertion which typically manifests itself when she is trying to climb the 2.5 flights of stairs that she has at home. She feels shortness of breath requiring her to stop when she gets to the top. She denies exertional chest pain or lightheadedness. She denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or edema. She denies lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope. Currently she reports no symptoms of claudication. No regular exercise. A couple of times a day.

We did her surgery, and she had a very uneventful postoperative course.\nShe was discharged home on postoperative day seven and has continued to make progress. She is walking each day. Her medications include 5 mg of Norvasc, 25 mg of Toprol-XL, 20 mg of simvastatin and an aspirin and her Plaquenil. She has no complaints of pain. She is eating well. She is sleeping well. Her incisions have healed nicely. Her sternum is stable, and she has no murmurs. Overall, I am extremely pleased with her progress. I told her to suggest to you that she was interested in cardiac rehab which she should be able to start in the next week or two.\nThank you so much for the opportunity of caring for her.\nNorma Gonzalez, M.D.\ncc:Holly Xavia Avalos, M.D. Jackson X.

She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease. She was initially seen in March 2094, when she was admitted with fever, nausea and chest pain. Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration. She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1:2560 speckled with positive RNP, negative Scl-70. Clinically, she had Sjogren's with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face. The Raynaud's was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 11\/2095. Slowly these lesions healed.\nInterim Issues: The diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled. But on exercise tolerance test, she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis. In April 2097 she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed. Recovering from surgery has been slow. But it has been steady and uncomplicated. She can now go up 2 flights of stairs, then rest to go the third flight to her home. She has had no recurrent chest pain. She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage. She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath (points anteriorly), but no dyspnea per se. She healed well postoperatively. She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr. Nichols and seems to be in good shape. Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR.\n\nIn terms of the MCTD, she continues to have some Raynaud's. She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands. What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis. She felt much better on 5 mg of prednisone daily. She remains on Plaquenil 200 mg daily. She has had no worsening swallowing. She has had no fever, pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion. She sleeps on two pillows. She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth. She continues on omeprazole. Complete ROS in detail is otherwise negative.\nMEDS: Amlodipine 5 MG QD Aspirin 325 MG QD Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 MG QD Lisinopril 2.5 MG QD Metformin 500 MG BID Metoprolol Succinate Extended Release 25 MG QD Plaquenil 200 MG QD Simvastatin 20 MG QHS\n\nFH\/SH: She comes in with her husband, who feels she is doing very well and is delighted to see her better.

Although I'm sure you are familiar with his history, I will review it now for our records. Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old retired Electrician at Wells Fargo who by his report has enjoyed excellent health until the past year. He denies any prior history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, chest pains, significant childhood illnesses or malignancy. He describes his usual baseline health as excellent. He is a religious walker, walking multiple times each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast. Dr. Rodriquez states that in approximately April or Mayof the past year he was first diagnosed with hyperglycemia. This was treated with Metformin. Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added apparently for hypertension (although the patient does not believe he has been diagnosed with hypertension). He subsequently developed diarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was subsequently reduced in dose. In June of the past year the patient was noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his Hydrochlorothiazide. At that time he also was found to have lower extremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the Hydrochlorothiazide. The patient states in September of 2119 he traveled to trinidad and tobago. While in trinidad and tobago he had a marked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he found it difficult to ambulate. He denied any difficulty with chest pains or shortness of breath. He had no hemoptysis and no focal unilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility during the trip. He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an ethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema significantly. However, he subsequently developed diarrhea to this medication and it was stopped. Subsequently his lower extremity has once again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of Lasix and with the recent addition of Zaroxolyn. At the present time Dr. Rodriquez states that he has no overt shortness of breath. He still able to sing vigorously and to play woodwinds without any\nPage 2 Freeman Faust, M.D. RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. January 18, 2120\nlimitation. He does find ambulating difficult due to the swelling in his lower extremities. He has no chest pain, has no cough, no sputum production, no hemoptysis. He has no fevers or chills. He believes his weight is increased by 35 pounds in the past several months. He believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation. He denies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does note that he's becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and is often napping in the reclining chair which is new for him. He denies any history of snoring. He has noted no new joint complaints although he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface of his right lower extremity as well as on his left arm. This has been present for approximately two or three months. Other than that he believes his bowel and bladder function is normal. Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.\nHis past medical history is significant for: 1. Type II diabetes as above. 2. An apparent diagnosis of labile hypertension noted in his chart. 3. Anemia thought secondary to Hydrochlorothiazide. 4. Past history of right bundle branch block. He has no history of rheumatic fever.\nCurrent medications include Atenolol 25mg daily, folic acid, Glucophage 850mg bid, Lasix 120mg daily, Lisinopril 15mg daily, compression stockings, Metolazone 2.5mg daily was added recently.\nDrug allergies include possible hemolytic anemia due to Hydrochlorothiazide.\nFamily history is significant for diabetes mellitus.\nSocial history is assuming for the fact that the patient is an immigrant from trinidad and tobago. He has been living in Haleyville since the early 2059's. He is a Electrician at Wells Fargo. He has minimal exposure to chemicals in his research towards his bachelor's degree but none since then. He is a non tobacco user. He uses alcohol minimally. He's never had any blood transfusions. He lives with his wife. They have no pets. He does not enjoy any unusual hobbies not noted above. He has been exposed to tuberculosis in the past and has a history of a positive PPD.\nOn physical examination today Dr. Rodriquez weighs 193 pounds. Blood pressure is 136\/90. Pulse 83 and regular. Respiratory rate is 20. Temperature is 96.8. Resting oxygen saturation is 98-99% with ambulation in the hallway. This fell to a minimum of 97% with an increase in his heart rate to 100. HEENT exam is significant for a clear oropharynx. Sclera are white. Conjunctiva are minimally pale. Page 3 Freeman Faust, M.D. RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. January 18, 2120\nThe thyroid gland is normal. Jugular venous distention to approximately 10 cm. was noted. Neck was supple. Examination of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness at both bases. There was no egophony and no wheezes. Otherwise the lungs were clear. Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm, normal S1 and S2, an intermittent S4 was appreciated. No RV heave or lift was appreciated. No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated. The pontic component of S2 was moderately enhanced. No appreciable murmurs were detected. The point of maximum impulse was in the anterior axillary line. Examination of the abdomen revealed a nontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge, three fingerbreadths below the right costal margin. This was nontender and smooth. Minimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well. Normal bowel sounds were present. Examination of the extremities reveal three plus symmetric edema to the top of the thigh in the lower extremities, one plus edema was also present in both upper extremities. No clubbing was noted. There were no skin changes consistent with collagen vascular disease. Multiple follicular lesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh as well as on the left arm. Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal.\nObjective data include a CBC which most recently demonstrated a white count of 11.8, hematocrit of 32.1, platelet count of 250. Differential was not remarkable. LVH is elevated at 599, AST is most recently 22. A urinalysis on 12\/07\/19 was negative for protein. No reportive cast was made. A CEA was notable for a level of 2.4 on 1\/05\/20. An echocardiogram obtained on 12\/22\/19 demonstrated normal LV size with mild concentric LVH and preserved LV function. The right ventricle was mildly dilated and hypertrophied with mild reduction in RV function. There was trace MR with moderate TR. A peak systolic artery pressure of 64 plus right atrial pressure was noted.\nIn summary Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old gentleman with a clear cut pulmonary hypertension. The etiology of this is not clear at the moment. Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic disease, occult underlying pulmonary disease (doubt), obstructive sleep apnea, and collagen vascular disease. In addition some patients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the setting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left ventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of exclusion. The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree with increasing his diuretic regimen. I'm embarking on a course of evaluation to exclude the most likely causes. In specific he will be having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic disease this afternoon. This has already been arranged by Dr. Faust. In addition I'm sending serology including an ANA, an antidouble stranded DNA and an anti SCL70. I've also asked Dr. Rodriquez Page 4 Freeman Faust, M.D. RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. January 18, 2120\nto undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea. He will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal pulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an arterial blood gas drawn. If this evaluation should be unrevealing, he may require more invasive diagnostics. I've already consulted formally with Dr. Eddie Roy, the physician with most experience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would be able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. Rodriquez if our workup is nondiagnostic.\nDr. Faust, thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation. I'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after his diagnostic tests have been performed. Please do not hesitate to call me with any further questions or concerns.\nSincerely,\n\nJose Church, M.D.\n\/ray\nDD: 01\/18\/20 DT: 01\/19\/:0 DV: 01\/18\/20\n\n\n* Record date: 2120-09-08\nMARY EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT\n\nRODRIQUEZ,JACOB 863-35-65-5 VISIT DATE: 09\/08\/20\nI saw and examined the patient personally.

He is a former patient of Dr. Ilya Light. He is a 59-year-old man with diabetes type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and mild coronary artery disease who had a brief episode of atrial flutter in 2069. He presented in 2069 with chest pain and rapid heart rate following snow shoveling. He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response. He was cardioverted two days later and has remained in sinus rhythm since then. Echocardiogram performed on 02\/22\/2069 showed normal ejection fraction of 72%, borderline left atrium at 43 mm, and no significant valvular abnormalities. Stress test performed on 03\/16\/2069 showed 5 minutes of exercise, 7 METS, and a peak double product of 22, 000. He had no EKG changes, and a small mild posterobasilar defect suggestive of a very limited area of mild ischemia. The patient has been managed medically since then. He has used an event monitor and since then has not had any subsequent episodes of atrial flutter or fibrillation.\n\nThe patient has been doing well over the past several months. Currently, he exercises once or twice a week by swimming 30 minutes in a pool. A few months ago, he was exercising almost everyday. His weight has been up and down. He does not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. Occasionally in the morning when he takes his pulse, he notices a skipped beat. I have reassured him that this is not a cause for concern.\n\nPast medical history:\nDiabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial flutter as above, coronary artery disease as above, Bell's palsy with residual left eye tearing, kidney stones, and glaucoma.\n\nCurrent Medications:\nlisinopril 20 mg QD\nGlucophage 1 g BID\nglyburide 10 mg BID\natenolol 50 mg QAM; Dir: and 25 mg QPM\nLopid 600 mg BID\nallopurinol 300 mg QD\nomeprazole 20 mg QD\naspirin 81 mg QD\nPravachol 80 mg QD\nAvandia 8 mg QD\n\nAllergies:\nPenicillin allergy Penicillin and erythromycin, causing rash.\n\nFamily history:\nNot significant for coronary artery disease.\n\nSocial history:\nFormer tobacco user, works part time in securities.\n\nReview of systems:\nAs above, otherwise negative.\n\nPhysical examination:\n-Pulse: 60\n-General: Obese talkative man in no distress\n-Chest: Lungs are clear bilaterally\n-Cardiac: JVP is 7 cm with normal waveform. PMI is discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. Soft 2\/6 holosystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border\n-Abdomen: Obese and tender\n-Extremities: Have trace edema with chronic venous stasis changes\n\nSelected recent labs:\nOn 06\/18\/2070, total cholesterol 168, triglycerides 104, HDL 38, and LDL 109. His Pravachol dose has been increased since this time.\n\nAssessment and plan:\nThis is a 59-year-old man with metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and mild coronary artery disease that has been medically managed. He is doing well. He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in 2069 but has not had any repeat episodes. He is currently not anticoagulated. Given new recommendations, his target LDL should be less than 70. He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week. If his LDL is not below 70, then he should either be switched to Lipitor 80 mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen. He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of 140\/75. The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male. In the office today, if his blood pressure remains elevated, then I will increase his lisinopril to 30 mg a day. Otherwise, he is doing very well without any cardiac symptoms.\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\nlisinopril 20 mg QD\nGlucophage 1 g BID\nglyburide 10 mg BID\natenolol 50 mg QAM and 25 mg QPM\nLopid 600 mg BID\nallopurinol 300 mg QD\nomeprazole 20 mg QD\naspirin 81 mg QD\nPravachol 80 mg QD\nAvandia 8 mg QD\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.\n\n\n\n\nSteven Vega MD\n\nSigned electronically by Steven Vega MD on Feb 3, 2071\n\n* Record date: 2072-11-16\n\nInternal Medicine JAR ADMIT NOTE\nName: Xander Vera MR #: 2152363 Date of admission: 11\/16\/2072 Attending: Hodges Cards Fellow: Steven Vega PCP: Dr. Xavier Huerta Code: FULL CC: SOB, LE edema\nHPI: 60M with obesity, DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and stress test in 2069 with mild posterobasal reversible defect managed medically sent to ED by PCP for LE edema and SOB.

They both attribute it to the Prilosec.\n\nHe now sleeps well and does not use his wedge. He has no snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work.\n\nAllergies and nasal congestion are not evident.\n\nNo lower extremity edema, swollen glands, or fevers.\n\nMildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping.\n\nOn examination, he is well appearing. Respiratory rate 22 and unlabored. Blood pressure 90\/50 with a small cuff. Conjunctivae are clear. Oropharynx is clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter or adenopathy. Back: Normal configuration. Chest: Normal percussion note, good air movement bilaterally; fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases. Cardiac: Faint left parasternal impulse, mildly prominent P2, normal S1, S2, without murmur, rub, or gallop. JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass. Extremities: No cyanosis or edema, borderline clubbing.\n\nPulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry, a slight down- . in total lung capacity, but still approximately 70% predicted, and DLCO stable in the 60% predicted range.\n\nMy review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.\n\nImpression:\n\n1. Interstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status. Pulmonary function tests - Overall, these were stable, and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis. However, as I reviewed with the patient and his wife, it is well established that 10% of the time, another disorder, such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy. There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease. He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.\n\n2. GE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis. If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle, he can have very good control of this.\n\n3. Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n4. Possible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms, now that his reflux is well controlled.\n\n5. Chronic cough.\n\n6. Diabetes - Better controlled.\n\n7. Obesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program. As I mentioned to him, he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight, but he is starting to make some progress.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. Continue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d. dosing, as well as lifestyle modifications, including marked decrease in caffeine intake.\n\n2. Referral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.\n\n3. Cardiovascular evaluation by you, prior to his surgery, would be appreciated.\n\nIt has been a pleasure to participate in his care. Please feel free to call with any questions or comments.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nPaul N.

For example, he notes that going up the four stairs to the house with bundles he is mildly short of breath and has to rest.\n\nThe cough is slightly increased to 3\/10, but is markedly better than on presentation.\n\nHe has no leg edema, chest pain, skin rash, joint problems, or fevers.\n\nHe has managed to lose 6 lbs. by giving up sweets, and his sugars are slightly better.\n\nGE reflux is very well controlled.\n\nMedications: Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d, aspirin, Glyset, Actose, metformin, metoprolol, Lipitor, and Hyzaar.\n\nOn Examination: He is well appearing. Blood pressure 110\/60, respiratory rate 20 and unlabored. Oropharynx is clear. Conjunctivae are clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter. Chest: Normal percussion note, well-healed VATS scar; fine inspiratory crackles 1\/3 of the way up bilaterally with coarser crackles over the axilla. Cardiac: Normal apex beat, normal P2, no murmur, JVP less than 8 cm with equivocal HJR. Abdomen: Obese, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass. Extremities: No edema, borderline clubbing, no cyanosis.\n\nExercise oximetry: Saturation at rest 96% and after treadmill ergometry 94%.\n\nPulmonary function tests today by my review show an FEV1 and FVC that are decreased by approximately 10%, total lung capacity decreased by 1 liter, and DLCO down from 20 to 14.\n\nWeight is 238 lbs. (BMI 38).\n\nImpression:\n\n1. Biopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The biopsy reading is somewhat unusual, and I will review this at our Pulmonary group weekly meeting, particularly with an eye to agents that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia. I continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the low-benefit regiment of prednisone, with an immunosuppressant agent. I think he may be a very good candidate for gamma-interferon, but unfortunately not every one benefits from this.\n\nI emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed, or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux. If the disease was, indeed, progressing, we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup. The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity. I calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 190 lbs. to get to a BMI of 30, and that by the time of listing he needed to have a BMI of approximately 32. Hence, he has his work cut out for him.\n\n2. Obesity - As above.\n\n3. Diabetes.\n\n4. Possible coronary artery disease - He apparently did fine on his preoperative cardiac workup.\n\n5. GE reflux - As mentioned.\n\n6. Cough - Mainly due to GE reflux, and less prominent contribution from the pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. Add Reglan 10 mg b.i.d.\n\n2. Continue Prilosec 40 mg b.i.d. - as 20 mg b.i.d. did not give full control with the generic pills.\n\n3. We will review pathology.\n\n4. Follow-up visit with full pulmonary function tests in one month.\n\n5. I strongly urged him to continue a steady, but progressive weight loss program - I expect that his life will depend upon it.\n\nIt has been a pleasure to participate in his care. Please feel free to call with any comments or questions.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nPaul N.

He as treated with high dose Solumedrol and with antibiotics, and is improving nicely. He is extubated and has begun to eat.\nDiabetes was diagnosed 14 years ago. He was treated with pioglitazone 45 mg qd, metformin 2000 mg in divided doses and a sulfonylurea until February of this year, when the sulfonylurea was replaced with insulin. For convenience with his travel schedule, his insulin has been 70\/30 administered by pen, with 30 U before breakfast and 40 U before supper. He tests his BS before breakfast and supper only and reports that, since he has been more careful with his diet recently, they have been in the low 100 s and mid 100 s, respectively. His hemoglobin A1c was 7.4 % a month ago. Retinopathy: He is due for his yearly appointment with his ophthalmologist. No retinopathy in the past. Nephropathy: BUN\/Cr 31\/1.3 today. No microalbumin\/creatinine ratio in CAS. Neuropathy: He has occasional paresthesias in his feet. Cardiac: He is s\/p stent for coronary artery disease about 8-9 years ago. Vascular: No claudication.\nHis IPF is treated with Mucomyst and gamma interferon, which he administers to himself.\nPast Medical History: Surgery: Coronary stent Lung biopsy at time of diagnosis of IPF Medical: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia GERD Allergies: No known drug allergies. Smoking History: No Alcohol History: No\nFamily History: There is a significant family history of diabetes, including his mother, maternal grandmother, one of his 5 siblings, and some paternal relatives as well.\nSocial History: Lives with his wife and their adopted son, who is a Recruitment Officer.

Neurological: AJ 1+,=, with normal relaxation.\nImpressions and Plan: 59 year old man with type 2 diabetes now on steroids for IPF flare, currently down to 125 mg q12h, given at noon and MN. Having reviewed his recent data, would suggest that we change his current insulin to: NPH 40 \/ Regular 10+ scale qAM before breakfast Regular 10+ scale qPM before supper NPH 30 at bedtime QID Regular sliding scale These initial doses will need to be adjusted based on experience and on any changes in the steroid doses. I have no objection to resuming his pioglitazone, or substituting rosiglitazone while he is here, as long as you do not feel that volume overload is playing any role in his deterioration. I would prefer not to resume the metformin while is at risk for acute respiratory deterioration with risk of acidosis. Would change the steroid dosing to 8AM, 8 PM, hoping that we can also start to reduce the doses, PM first, if possible. He appears to have an anemia that has at least a component of iron deficiency. If you agree, would start iron repletion. (Note that in addition to the iron studies, his MCV, though still normal, has come down over time.)\nThanks.\nNicholas Q.

Mr. Horn was most recently admitted from 12\/11\/94 through 12\/30\/94 for complaints of severe fatigue and dyspnea, although without symptoms of infection or acute graft rejection. His main complaint was generalized weakness and fatiguability even w\/ very minimal activity. Additionally, he reported a very poor appetite and continued weight loss.\nDuring that admission, he was transfused to a Hct>30 and his PFTs ultimately returned back to baseline. His weakness was felt to be primarily related to his malnutrition as he was documented as having an inadequate caloric intake. Nutrition was consulted, a PEG tube was placed and tube feeds were started to supplement his nutrition. He was discharged without incident on 12\/30.\nThe patient continued w\/ Nepro boluses and nocturnal TF at home and demonstrated an 8 lb weight gain in less than 2 months. He was improving until blood work revealed a positive CMV antigenemia (7 cells) on 1\/29\/95. Transplant ID was consulted and the patient was restarted on Valcyte 450 QOD, and then later bumped up to QD dosing based on ID recommendations. He again experienced myelosuppression and was started on neupogen 300 mcg sc qd on 2\/14\/95 for a WBC of 0.6. At that time is HCT was 24.8 and PLTs 32K.\nA repeat CBC was obtained today and revealed worsening myelosuppression; Hct 21.6\/Hgb 6.9, WBC 0.4 and PLTs 15K.

As you know, she has a long and complex history of peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts. Her left lower extremity bypass graft had occluded once previously, but was successfully restored by Dr. Tejeda. In 02\/61, we had detected a high-grade stenosis in the distal aspect of this graft by surveillance, and she underwent revision with a local patch angioplasty. A subsequent ultrasound study done in 04\/61 showed a widely patent graft and she has remained entirely asymptomatic. She is not particularly active. She denies any rest pain in the feet or significant claudication symptoms. Recently, however, her husband had noticed some cyanosis of her left toes. She remains on low dose aspirin in addition to Lipitor and her other medications. She is a nonsmoker.\n\nOn examination today, she appeared well and in good spirits. Blood pressure was measured at 130\/60 in the right arm. Lower extremity pulses are 2+ at the femoral level bilaterally. On the right, there is a strong, easily appreciated pulse over her popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass graft, and the foot is warm and well perfused. On the left, I could not appreciate a pulse over her bypass graft incisions. The left foot is slightly cooler than the right, and there are some mild cyanotic changes on the first toe in particular. There are no frank or impending ulcerations or areas of irreversible ischemia. There is a strong Doppler signal obtained over the posterior tibial artery at the ankle with an occlusion pressure of approximately 100 mmHg. This yields an ankle index of nearly 0.7 and maybe falsely elevated. A follow-up ultrasound study was performed in the vascular laboratory today. The right lower extremity bypass remains widely patent. As suspected, the left lower extremity bypass has now demonstrated to be occluded.\n\nMs. Ferrara left lower extremity bypass graft has occluded sometime during the last several months and her collateralization is clearly more marginal. At the present time, she does not have any clear-cut symptoms of critical limb ischemia, though the slight discoloration of her toes is a clear sign. The previous history of this graft including a prior thrombosis requiring thrombectomy and multiple revisions would not board well for any attempted thrombolysis or repeated rescue of this particular conduit. Conversely, she has already had all of her lower extremity veins used for bypass operations and any redo bypass would be technically complicated. I will need to review her previous angiograms from earlier this year to determine the status of her runoff and what the alternatives might be. At the present time, however, she appears to have marginal, though reasonable collateralization and is essentially asymptomatic. I think it would be reasonable to increase her antithrombotic therapy and I added a daily dose of Plavix to supplement a baby aspirin. I spent sometime discussing the signs of worsening ischemia including more diffuse cyanotic skin changes of the toes, rest pain, or ulceration. At a minimum, I will see her back in two months for reexamination, but I strongly encouraged the patient and her husband to contact us soon if there are any symptoms that suggest worsening of her circulation. If her collateralization can remain stable, it certainly would be preferable to avoid having to consider a complex redo bypass with very limited remaining vein in this patient.\n\nThank you again for allowing us to participate in her care. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nRicardo Jacob Updyke, MD\n\n\nCC: Robin U.

She is now approximately one month out from a redo left popliteal to peroneal artery bypass graft using a basilic vein from right arm. Postoperatively, she did well, although she was very sensitive to pain medication in the hospital and it was difficult to get her moving. She complains of persistent weakness and numbness in her right hand and some pain shooting into her right forearm. According to the patient, this was present early during her hospitalization, but because of other issues, it was not paid very much attention. She denies any significant pain in the leg.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination today, she appears generally well. The right arm harvest site is healed well and the upper arm is soft without any evidence of hematoma, whatsoever. The hand is warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses; however, she clearly has weakness of flexion of the first and second digits and some weakness of opposition. She appears to have intact ulnar and radial function. The lower extremity incision has also healed well and there is a strong Doppler signal over the peroneal artery at the ankle. The foot is warm and well perfused and the previous ischemic lesion on the big toe is healing. She had a followup graft scan today, which revealed her bypass graft to be patent with no evidence of significant narrowing. The ankle index was measured at 0.88 on the left and 0.64 on the right.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. Ferrara lower extremity circulation is stable and her bypass graft is functioning nicely. Unfortunately, she appears to have had some neuropathic complication in her right arm that may have been related to her vein harvest surgery. The exam suggests some possible partial comprise of median nerve function. In any case, she is able to function reasonably well and a course of occupational therapy may improve things. There is no evidence of compression from hematoma and no evidence of infection. We will continue to follow her closely with a return visit scheduled in six weeks and a course of therapy was prescribed.\n\n\n\nRicardo Jacob Updyke, MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2067-03-10\n\n\n\nPCC: Respiratory\n26 Monica Street\nBuena Vista, CT 84376\n272-413-0358\n\nFERRARA, LAUREN\n48185437\n03\/10\/2067\n\nMAJOR DIAGNOSIS: Lung mass.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Lauren is a 75-year-old woman. She has only a very remote history of smoking, smoking not at all after the age of 30. In early March, she was undergoing a routine physical. At that time, she reported she had some mild weight loss. However, she had been trying to lose weight. She had no respiratory symptoms of dyspnea or cough. A chest x-ray was obtained, which revealed a 6 cm left lung mass. The patient subsequently had a CT scan. The CT scan revealed a 4 x 6 lung mass in the posterior subsegment of the right upper lobe. There were some modestly enlarged hilar nodes, but all below 2 cm. She has some tiny sub 5 mm nodules in both lungs. The patient is referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Jordon for further evaluation. The patient has no history of lung. She has no history of asthma or allergies. She has not had any history of TB or a positive PPD. She may have had some mild asbestos exposure when she worked in a publishing company, which had asbestos containing pipes. She has no history of malignancy. She has no avocational exposures to dust or danders.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes:\n1. Mild vascular dementia.\n2. Hypertension.\n3. Hyperlipidemia.\n4. Diabetes.\n5. Hypothyroidism.\n6. Peripheral vascular disease.\n7. Anemia.\n8. Renal artery stenosis with mild renal failure.\n9. Carotid artery stenosis.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Levoxyl 88 mcg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, Aricept 10 mg a day, furosemide 20 mg a day, nifedipine 90 mg a day, Crestor 20 mg a day, metoprolol 25 mg a day, calcium, Zetia 10 mg a day, vitamin D, Nephrocaps 1 mg a day, fish oil, aspirin 81 mg a day.\n\nALLERGIES: Penicillin and estrogens and red dye #5.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her husband. She does not drink. She has a very remote smoking history in her teens and early 20s.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise, negative.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is in no distress. Her O2 saturation is 95%. Her blood pressure is 130\/70, her pulse is 53. Head and neck exam: She is normocephalic and atraumatic. Her nares are without discharge. Oropharynx with dentures. She has no erythema or exudate. Neck is supple without adenopathy, thyromegaly, or bruits. Her thorax is kyphotic. She has normal fremitus and percussion. Her lungs are clear. Cardiac exam: No JVD, S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs. Abdomen is soft. Extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. She has residual of vascular surgery in her legs. She has slightly diminished peripheral pulses.\n\nLABORATORY DATA: Spirometry is normal.\n\nIMAGING STUDIES: A chest CT is as noted.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 75-year-old with a large right lung mass. This is likely to be malignant, although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible. At this point, I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan. Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub 5mm and may not be related to this malignancy. She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes. I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection. She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur. She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder. Otherwise, she will follow up with Oncology. If she was deemed not to be an appropriate surgical candidate, either because of metastatic disease or because of comorbidity, she could have this lesion biopsied via a transthoracic needle aspirate.\n\n\n\nPamela Falk, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:5-33744827 EMSSten Tel\n\nCC: Jaclyn Jordon M.D.\nMondovi Hospital\n566 Ferncroft Drive\nUnion City, CT, 33636\nFax:\nEmail:\n\n\n\nDD: 03\/10\/67\nDT: 03\/10\/67\nDV: 03\/10\/67\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2096-07-15\n\nResults01\/31\/2096 GLU-POC 159 (*)10\/03\/2095 GLU-POC 11211\/05\/2095 HGBA1C 7.8 (*)\nSpanish 30 Dan Chan OSWALDO AUSTIN, HENRY Angels City, NH 31731 64415974 (729) 481-3539 07\/15\/96\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nMr. Austin is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador 2 days ago. He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina. While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated to the left upper arm and patient discribed it as sharp burning pressure. He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes. There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED. An EKG was normal and he was discharged on NG. Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized. On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have diffuse CAD involving several vessels. Stent placement was not attempted. His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward. A day later, on July 3rd, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July 5 on the following medication:\nASA 81 mg Plavix 75 mg po qd Bisoprolol 5mg po qd Isosorbide 20 mg one po in am 1\/2 po in pm Ranitidine 300 mg po qd Lipitor 40 mg po qd A sleeping medication 3 mg ?Lexotan one po hs Metformin 1000 mg po bid\nMr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital. He then experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes. It is worth noting that ETT here in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was was read as not suggestive of ischemia:\nTesting performed: STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER M-Mode: 2D Quality: Conclusion: 1. Patient exercised 6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol, reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue. No chest pain was reported. Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154\/68. The maximum rate-pressure product was 18,942.2. See exercise report for full ECG details. Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm. There were 1 mm horizontal\/upsloping ST depressions in leads V3-6 and lead II at peak exercise.3. Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals: Normal left ventricular size and systolic function. Estimated resting ejection fraction is 60%. No resting segmental wall motion abnormalities. Trace mitral regurgitation.4. Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise reveal: Normal increase in overall systolic function, with an estimated ejection fraction of >80%. All segments augment normally, without inducible wall motion abnormalities.SUMMARY: No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia, atslightly less than target heart rate (which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam).ATTENDING STAFF: WINSTON,LATASHA V,M.D,PH.D.

As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at 06\/28\/2096 in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction. I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery. I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings.\n\nThe patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti. At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged. He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto. He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions 95 and 99%), first OM(90%) and his right ( dominant vessel with an 80% proximal and then 90% distal). An LV gram showed an EF of 55% with just mild mitral regurgitation. An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent.\n\nSince he has returned to America several weeks ago, he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort, which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic. Since then, he has had no further episodes.\nROS: Denies PND, orthopnea, symptoms of TIA, stroke, lightheaded, or syncope. He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion.\nPMH: Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, stroke (numbness in his right hand and leg, but that had predominantly resolved).\nMeds: aspirin 81 mg a day, clopidogrel 75 mg a day, bisoprolol 5 mg once a day, ranitidine 300 mg a day, atorvastatin 40 mg a day, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d, and Imdur 20 mg in the morning and 10 in the evening. This is an Equadorian formulation.\nSHx: He does not drink, nor smoke.\nFHx: Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at 60. Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate.\n\nOn exam, he looks well. His heart rate is in the 64. His blood pressure was 115\/70. His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits. His jugular venous pressures were not elevated. His chest was clear to auscultation. His cardiac exam revealed a 2\/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex. His abdomen was soft. Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses. Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit.\n\n\nIn summary, Mr. Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3-vessel disease. He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory. I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding.\n\nWith warm regards,\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2096-10-04\nGraydon Harold Jean, MD Nevada Hospital Internal Medicine 72 Dan Chan Angels City, NH 31731\nDear Dr. Jean:\n\n\nYour patient Henry Oswaldo was seen today by myself at the Atmore Community Hospital today following coronary artery bypass on August 15, 2096. He has had a relatively unremarkable recovery with out complication. Today, Mr. Oswaldo looks and feels well, and complains of no issues. On examination, the lungs are clear, cardiac rate and rhythm are normal. The incision is healing very nicely.\nChest radiograph reveals normal findings. EKG shows no acute changes and is basically normal. His rate is mildly elevated today despite being on a beta blocker.\nPatient education was completed with respect to: medication review, weight restriction\/lifting\/activities, cardiac rehabilitation.\nOverall, I am quite pleased with progress. He has increased activity and should plan to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation in a few weeks. He seems to be making an excellent recovery from surgery.\nThank you for the privilege of participating in the care of this very nice gentleman. I am confident the surgery will afford significant and lasting benefit and relief from symptoms of angina. I would consider increasing his Toprol dose, but will leave this to your discretion if his rate remains elevated in follow-up. I am releasing him to your care. We would be happy to see him at any time in the future, if you should so desire.\n\nWith warm regards,\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2096-11-18\n\n\nSpanish 71 Dan Chan OSWALDO AUSTIN, HENRY Angels City, NH 31731 64415974 (729) 481-3539 11\/18\/96\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nMr. Austin is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA who returns to the practice three months after undergoing CABG for multiple vessel disease.

Yamilex is a 68-year-old woman who I know quite well status post a stroke in 2083.\nIn 2083 Mrs. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness. She was found to have a left vertebral stenosis and a left posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution stroke. She was found to be hypertensive at that time and was started on atenolol.\nMrs. Ordonez blood pressure was not well controlled on atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide. Triamterene was added. Unfortunately she represented with recurrent ataxia and dizziness possibly due to overtreatment of her blood pressure. Of note, she was only mildly orthostatic at that time. She also had an E. coli urinary tract infection which may have been complicating matters.\nMrs. Ordonez has had borderline glucose intolerance as well as an elevated alkaline\/phosphatase. She had had a hemoglobin A1C of 6% tested in 2083.\nYamilex is generally doing well. She has no particular complaints. She has had an active summer getting out to the beach and walks the shopping mall with her daughter with good energy. She has had no chest pains, shortness of breath, alterations in her bowel or bladder habits.\nMedications: Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 3.75 q.d. for her history of vertebral artery stenosis and atenolol 75 q.d.\nPhysical examination: Blood pressure was 170\/90. Heart rate was 82 and regular. The HEENT examination was unremarkable. Neck was supple without adenopathy. There were 2+ carotids without bruits and there were no vertebral bruits. Chest was clear to auscultation. Cardiac exam showed an S4 gallop. Abdomen examination was benign and extremities were without edema. Neurological examination showed reflexes to be 2+ in the upper extremities and at the knees bilaterally with downgoing toes. Finger-nose-finger was intact, Romberg was intact, and gait was stable with a narrow base.\nAssessment and plan:\n1. Hypertension. Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure is currently not well controlled. She has unfortunately had inadequate follow up for her hypertension. I will start her on 5 mg. of Zestril in addition to her standing 75 of atenolol.\n2. Neurologic. Mrs. Ordonez is stable status post her stroke. She will continue on Coumadin. I will not plan any further neurological work up at this time.\n3. Primary care issues. Mrs. Ordonez had a cholesterol in 2083 of 210. I will test a follow up cholesterol level given that she needs good secondary prevention status post her stroke. I will also check a random glucose level today as diabetes does run in the family and Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline elevated sugars in the past.\nI have also started Mrs. Ordonez on a multivitamin with minerals as well as 800 IU a day of vitamin E at the recommendation of Dr. Quesenberry. I will see Mrs. Ordonez in approximately six to eight weeks to reassess her blood pressure and her response to the addition of lisinopril.\nThe patient was seen with Richard Quesenberry, M.D.\n\nMichael Goldberg, M.D.\nHH:SF:0151 DD:9-28-85 DT:10-03-85 DV:9-28-85\n\n* Record date: 2086-08-02\nThis is my first visit with Ms. Ordonez, for whom this is a routine physical.\n\n68 yo pleasant white woman with the following problems:\n\n1. Left vertebral stenosis\nMs. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness in 2083 and was found to have an infarct in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Work-up revealed left vertebral stenosis. She recovered after the event to her baseline, and now has no complaints of HA, dizziness, ataxia, paresthesias, or motor weakness. She is chronically anticoagulated and followed in coumadin clinic; recent INR was 2.6.\n\n2. Hypertension\nDuring her 2083 admission for CVA, Ms. Ordonez was found to be severely hypertensive. She is now on Atenolol 75 mg po qd and Zestril 10 mg po qd for control of her hypertension. She does not measure her blood pressure at home.\n\n3. Diabetes mellitus\nMs. Ordonez has NIDDM for which she takes Micronase 5 mg BID with fairly good control. She has no known history of retinopathy, nephropathy, CAD, or neuropathy. She has no complaints of visual changes, chest pain\/SOB, paresthesias, or bloating\/early satiety. She has noticed some increase in thirst (7 glasses of water\/day) which she attributes to the heat and she has nocturia (2x per night) which has been stable over a couple of years.\n\n4. Dyslipidemia\nMs. Ordonez has a history of elevated total cholesterol; I don't think she has had a fasting lipid panel.\n\n5. Benign breast disease\nMs. Ordonez has diffusely fibronodular breasts. Microcalcifications were noted on mammography and bilateral excisional biopsies revealed benign fibroadenoma without evidence of malignancy. Mammography on 7\/28\/86 was normal.\n\n6.

Left vertebral stenosis: Patient has not had recurrent symptoms since her CVA in 2083 and she is neurologically intact by my neuro exam. She is therapeutic on her coumadin. She will continue coumadin and I will attempt to address CVA risk factors such as HTN and dyslipidemia (will avoid lowering BP excessively to preserve vertebral perfusion).\n\n2. Hypertension: Patient is quite hypertensive (170\/90) on current regimen of Atenolol 75 mg qd and Zestril 10 mg qd. Her heart rate is 74; I will increase her Atenolol to 100 mg qd. She does not complain of any side effects from her medications. She does have a chronic, mild dry cough which is possibly related to her Zestril.\n\n3. Diabetes Mellitus\nMs. Ordonez takes Micronase 5 mg BID for blood sugar control; she does not measure her glucose at home. She has had a little polydipsia\/polyuria. Today I will check a glucose and HbA1c level. Her UA today is negative and I will check a spot urine microalbumin\/Cr ratio. On her next visit I will schedule an ophthalmology appointment. She is on an ACE inhibitor.\n\n4. Dyslipidemia\nThe patient has had a recent cholesterol of 206. I will obtain a fasting lipid panel.\n\n5. Benign breast disease\nExcisional biopsy showed benign fibroadenoma, mammography on 7\/28\/86 was normal. She has diffuse fibronodular disease on exam today. I have instructed her in self-examination.\n\n6. Skin lesion\nMs. Ordonez' skin lesion looks like it may be a suborrheic keratosis or squamous cell. I will refer to a dermatologist.\n\n7. Health maintenance\nI discussed both hormone replacement therapy and screening flexible sigmoidoscopy with Ms. Ordonez and she has declined both. She also does not want a pneumovax today, although she is willing to have her tetanus. She has also agreed to start taking calcium\/vitamin D as well as an MVI. She has had recent mammography.\n\nFollow-up: I will see Ms. Ordonez in one month to check her blood pressure on her increased dose of Atenolol.\n\n* Record date: 2087-03-21\n\nSTANTON NURSING HOME PRIMARY CARE 093 Balcom Street, Eigth Floor Oil City, VA 14172\nRE: Ordonez, Mrs. SNH#: 008-37-16\nMarch 21, 2087\nReason for visit: Patient is a 59 year old woman seen today together with Dr. Barajas.\nMEDICATIONS: She is currently on atenolol 50 mg b.i.d, HCTZ 50 mg q.d, Zestril 20 mg q.d.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her blood pressure is 150\/80 with a pulse of 76.\nPLAN: 1.

She di dnot take tegretol, but rather increased her amytriptiline and added some darvocet acutely, now off these meds. Her R eye tears a lot, at no particular time (ie, not necessarily when she's masticating), and occasionally it burns.but she has not developed conjunctivitis or ocular redness or discharge. She has difficulty chewing opn the R side of her mouth, and finds shepockets food in her R cheek; she manages by chewing on L, and swallowing frequently, especially taking extra liquids.\nThe pain has receded- she now only gets a twinge now and then.\n\nHusband has noticed she's not hearing quite as well.\n\nHer current meds include amitryptiline 25 hs, mevacor 20, procardia 30 bid, furosemide 40x3, isosorbide 20 qd allopurinol 300 qd. She's releived to learn the results of her recent blood work, including BUN 65 Creat 3.4, Hct 29.8\n\nOn exam, she has gained weight since I last saw her; she comes in ok0on wheelchair, but is able to take a few steps with her straight cane, and climb onto the examining tabloe with only contact guard. Dense catarcts; fundi not visualized; EOMS full without ptosis or nystagmus. Cornelas are brisk pilaterally, but she has decreased sensationon the R lower facial segments (V1, V2); excellent masseter and temporalis strength. R lower facial weakness, with less evident weakness of orbicularis oculi; he manages to close the eyelid almost completely; + Bell's phenomenon.

Since her last visit to the clinic, she was evaluated by Dr. Frederick Archer who admitted her for a diagnostic angiogram, which revealed that she had adequate perfusion to the ankle level to heal the ulceration. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, Mrs. Fallon has ruborous discoloration of the distal half of her bilateral lower extremity with scattered vesicles on the anterior surface of her left lower extremity. The ulceration is on the posterior aspect of the right ankle. It measured 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm. The tissue is moist yellow subcutaneous tissue, the margin is clear. In the setting of ruborous discoloration, it appears that Mrs. Fallon may have an acute flare of her chronic lipodermatosclerosis. PLAN: Daily wound care per the following protocol; 1. Normal saline irrigation 30 cc x 3. A thin layer of 50% Diprolene ointment 0.05% with Bactroban cream to the wound bed and the wide periwound margin. Primary dressing will be Telfa covered with rolled gauze. Mrs. Fallon will return to clinic in 2 weeks unless the wound bed is closed and then she will follow up with Dr. Archer on Tuesday, November 26th.

This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 18 months ago, using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time. Also related, at least in part, to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI in December 2074. Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent- left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting, going away before she has time to try a SLTNG. In addition, Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower, on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis, which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal. She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD. She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low.

He has peripheral vascular disease with a prior left femoral-tibial bypass graft. He initially presented to the vascular surgery clinic with an ischemic ulceration in the right foot. There were no lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention and he underwent right common femoral artery to distal anterior tibial artery in situ saphenous vein bypass graft on 6\/01\/78. He was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on 6\/07 where he reports initially doing well. The patient was readmitted in early June because of fevers. No source of the fevers were determined but he was started on an empiric regimen of antibiotics. During that admission, every other staple in his wound was removed. The patient came back to clinic where all of his sutures were removed. The surgical site over the lower leg never completely healed and the open area was treated with daily dressing changes. He was seen in clinic for follow-up today where his wound was again noted to be open in proximity to the graft. Plastic surgery is consulted regarding closure options.\nPMH\/PSH: 1. CAD 2. HTN 3.

On the right lower extremity, there is an incision from the groin to the foot. It is well-healed with the exception of a 5 x 2 cm area over the lower third of the leg just medial to the tibia. The graft is palpable just lateral to the area. The base of the wound appears to have granulation tissue. No odor. There is minimal erythema and tenderness around the site. Distal pulses palpable. Foot warm and well-perfused but with no sensation below the ankle. There are other venous stasis ulcers in various stages of healing.

Most recently, he had undergone Rle necrotic ulcer debridement (07\/78),R CFA to distal anterior tibial BPG on 05\/78. The wound was overlying the BPG. He was made NWB on R, with VAC dressing applied to the wound to be changed twice weekly. He has been followed in clinic. Though he was noted to have good granulation tissue during his hospitalization one month ago, recently his wound has been concerning for non-healing. In clinic, his RLE is ischemic, and there is a concern for wound infection. The patient reports that the proximal aspect of his wound had pregressive breakdown over the past 2-3 weeks, with associated increase in pain, especially with VAC changes. He says that he could no longer feel a palpable graft pulse as he could just after the surgery. His foot became increasingly discolored, and his toe became necrotic after some minor trauma without response to silvadene.

This occurred despite his efforts to lose weight and his active participation in a weight watchers weight reduction program. The weight gain was accompanied by abdominal distension and bloating, increased leg swelling and increasing SOB. He also reports severe DoE, with a maximal walking distance of 5-6 steps, as well as a deteriorating a scrotal edema with some dysuria, and rectal incontinence. Since the recent weight gain, he also developed an extensive itchy erythema in his groins. He denies CP, diarrhea, HA, fever, chills, cough. His PCP prescribed metoclopramid and protonix for his abdominal complaints; however, the patient felt dizzy and dehydrated after taking these medications and decided to discontinue those. He also stopped taking his regular lasix medication about a week ago. Because of his increasing SOB, he called EMS, who found him cyanotic in his apartment with an Sa02 of 73% on RA.\nED Course: On arrival in the ED, his VS were: T98, BP108\/65, RR24, HR100, O2Sa 92% on 4L 02.

Joshua Morgan, M.D. Veterans Administration Roseburg Healthcare System 81 Goldfinch Lane Dothan, VT 74727\n\nRE: Walter Uribe HBH: 406-70-33 DOB: 3\/22\/68\n\nDear Dr. Joshua Morgan:\n\nI am seeing this 55-year-old gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities. The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again. The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress. The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years. He has never worn compression stockings. He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers. To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past. The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT. There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT. He has no personal history of cancer or trauma. He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.\n\nThe patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension.\n\nHis current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair.\n\nThe patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.\n\nThe patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion. He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.\n\nHis review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.\n\nOn physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right. He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes. He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation. He has a huge protuberant abdomen. There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant. He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses. His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus. On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+. He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right. He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch. He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left. The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.\n\nThe results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux. The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh. It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds. In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux. In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds. In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds. Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.\n\nIn summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration. Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data. I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position. Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency. This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs. All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling.\n\nThe solution to this problem is not an easy one. With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent. Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device. If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit. I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps. I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf. I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important. I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling. It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth. If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nMichael D. Roe, M.D.\n\nMR\/martin 60-38574514.doc\n\n* Record date: 2124-11-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMHFC 8 Intern Admission Note\n\nPATIENT: Walter Uribe\nMRN: 4067033\nADMIT DATE: 11\/22\/24\nPCP: Irvin Joshua Morgan, MD\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN: William Dugan, MD\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\nShortness of breath\n\nHISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS\nMr. Uribe is a 56 yo man with a history of CHF (EF 61%), COPD, OSA, PulmHTN, HTN, DMII, chronic venous stasis, and morbid obesity presenting to the ED with shortness of breath. Patient has had 2 prior admission (2121, 2122) for CHF exacerbations, last admission requiring lasix 80 IV TID to diurese 1-3L\/day. Patient states his dry weight is ~380lbs. He was recently in Amboy after surgery for nonhealing venous stasis ulcer and returned home in 9\/24. Upon returning home his weight was down to 342 lbs, however upon admission it is 409 lbs. Patients reports the past 3 weeks he has felt abdominal bloating, increased LE edema and increase dyspnea on exertion. At baseline he is able to ambulate short distances on his cane however now he is barely able to get up off the toilet. He also reports increased drainage from his RLE wound. He reports medication compliance except for missing 2-3 times over the past several weeks. He reports increased fluid intake including Progresso soup, ice water, diet coke and a &#8216;dash&#8217; of salt to his food. At baseline he requires 2L O2 during the day and 4L at night. His CPAP machine has been broken for the past week. He typically sleeps on 3 pillows but has recently increased to 4. He awakes from sleep often feeling short of breath and sits on the edge of his bed to catch his breath. Today he saw his PCP at Saint Mary's Hospital Fallbright Center for the above complaints and was sent immediately to the urgent care clinic. From there he was transferred to the HBH ED.\n\nIn the ambulance he received 40 mg IV lasix x 1 and had 1L of UOP. In the ED, VS were HR 106, BP 110\/80 RR 20 O2 sat 96% on 5L. He received another 40mg IV of lasix and put out 800 cc. Labs revealed a K of 3.1, Mg of 1.4, Hct of 35.4 and BNP of 1625. K and Mg were repleted. Diltiazem 30mg po x 1 was given for rapid afib. CXR showed stable interstitial edema. Patient was admitted to medicine for further work up.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\nGeneral &#8211; +weight gain; no fevers, chills, or night sweats\nPulmonary &#8211; no cough, + dyspnea, no wheezing, no hemoptysis\nCardiac &#8211; no chest pain, no palpitations, + orthopnea, + PND\nGastrointestinal &#8211; no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; no constipation; no changes in appetite; no abdominal pain\nGenitourinary &#8211; no dysuria, no frequency\nMusculoskeletal &#8211; left shoulder pain with movement\nExtremity &#8211; + lower extremity edema\nSkin &#8211; weepy RLE lesion\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\nCHF\nTTE 6\/24: EF 61% with dilated LA, thickened aortic leaflets, dilated RA, mild pulmonary insufficiency with RVSP 91 mmHg, dilated RV and RVH with diffuse hypokinesis BNP 584 baseline\nHTN COPD &#8211; on 3L home O2\nPFTs 2117 &#8211; FEV1 40% predicted, FVC 43% pred, ratio 95% pred, DLCO 72% pred, severe ventilatory defect with mild obstructive defect\nPulmonary HTN Diabetes mellitus type II &#8211; 7\/24 HgbA1c 6.2 Obstructive sleep apnea Hypercholesterolemia\nLipid panel in 1\/22 w\/ cholesterol 138, TG 82, HDL 58, LDL 64\nChronic venous stasis with recurrent leg ulcers Morbid obesity Peripheral neuropathy\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY\n7\/24 &#8211; skin graft to nonhealing venous stasis ulcer after excisional debridement\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\nMaternal &#8211; DM\nPaternal &#8211; angina\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nLives in Galion with his wife, son and daughter who lives downstairs. not working.

He was diagnosed with progressive shortness of breath in 2078. He was treated with diuretics and other medications at that time. He did quite well until December of last year when he had a cardiac arrest and underwent ICD placement. He has had worsening symptoms over the last year with increasing shortness of breath on flat ground and a very severe shortness of breath with stairs. He has had some episodic nature to this. Two days prior to admission, he had relatively rapid onset of shortness of breath while trying to play pool. This recurred several times associated with diaphoresis. He had no palpitations at that time. He has no chest discomfort.\nHis past medical history is significant for history of shower emboli and TIA in 2081. He has diabetes. He had spinal stenosis surgery in 2078.\nHis current medical regimen is Bumex 3, recently decreased from 12 due to worsening renal function. He is on spironolactone described as 6.25 daily, digoxin 0.125, Toprol-XL 12.5. He has been on carvedilol, which was changed due to dizziness. He is on lisinopril 1.25 mg and has had great difficulty tolerating any higher dose due to dizziness. He is on metolazone 2.5 weekly. He takes Coumadin 7.5 mg most days. He is on insulin and Lantus. He has no known drug allergies.\nHis family history is essentially unremarkable. Mother unknown, father had onset of angina in his 80s. The patient lives with his wife and son and is a retired Fire Chief. He had an 80-pack-year smoking history but quit four years ago. He has one glass of alcohol every 1-2 weeks.\nReview of systems is negative for any problems with fevers, chills, change in his bowel or bladder habits. He has no problems with swallowing. He has no problems with hearing or vision. Review of systems is otherwise negative.\nOn physical examination, blood pressure is 84\/66 in the left arm and 86\/62 in the right arm. His chest is completely clear to auscultation and percussion. Temperature is 35.9. His heart rate is 100 and a regular rhythm. His cardiac exam reveals left ventricular heave, which is visible. He has a palpable and audible third heart sound. The right ventricular impulse is present also. He has a systolic murmur, which is heard everywhere, not otherwise easy to characterize. It does not change with respiration. The second component of the second sound is slightly increased in radiation consistent with a PA systolic pressure in the range of 50-60. His legs are cool. Venous pattern is very prominent. His pulses are intact peripherally. He has no abdominal bruits. His jugular venous pressure is 14 cm. He has no cervical adenopathy or thyromegaly. His liver percusses at approximately 5 cm below the costal margin. He has some increased resonance around the umbilicus. Laterally, there is suggestion of some fluid in the distention. There is no peripheral edema. His joints are without obvious deformities, although he describes arthritis in his shoulder, neck, and back. He has no skin rashes or sores, several very small ecchymoses. His standing blood pressure is unchanged. He has atrially triggered ventricular pacing at 98.\nASSESSMENT: 1. Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction is undetermined. We do not know information of recent catheterization or echocardiography. The degree of his mitral disease is not clear. He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially. However, the episodicity is significant. 2. Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output, and is cold and wet pattern. His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change. However, the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected. It is also possible that this is related to angina. 3. Other related risks. He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before. It is possible that he has had other emboli, possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function.\nThere are no obvious contraindications to transplant. At this time, we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation. Our plan is to hold his beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for now, and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion. We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state.\nPatricia Cameron Izzo, MD Cardiac Services\n\n\neScription document:2-7203595 SFFocus\n\nDD: 10\/07\/83 DT: 10\/07\/83 DV: 10\/06\/83\n\n* Record date: 2083-12-30\nLantus and Novolog Insulin Guidelines\n\n1. Check blood sugars before meals and at bedtime. In addition, some meals you may want to check your blood sugar (blood glucose or BG) 1 hour after taking your Novolog. If it is over 150 you may need to take more Novolog with meals or decrease your carbohydrate intake. You do not have to do this at every meal and you can alternate meals and\/or days. For example: Sat check before and after breakfast; Friday - lunch; Thursday - supper,etc.\n2. Be careful of the amount of carbohydrates (breads, pasta, cereal, fruit, etc) you eat at each meal and between meals. Try to average about 60 gms. per meal and 15 gms. for snacks.\n3. The goal for your blood sugars when you get up in the morning and before meals is 80-110, 1 hour after taking Novolog (at the start of the meal) it is less than 140, and at bedtime 100 to 140.\n4. Your insulin may need adjusting several times before those goals can be met. When exercising you may need more carbs or less Novolog with meals.\n\nLong-acting insulin: Lantus (insulin glargine)\nTake 14 units at bedtime.\nDo not mix with any other insulin. Lantus starts to work in about 1 hr and lasts about\n24 hours. It has no peak.\nIf your fasting blood sugar for two or more mornings is more than 120, increase your\nLantus by 2 units at the next dose. If it is more than 140 for two mornings then\nincrease by 4 units at the next dose.\nIf your fasting blood sugar is less than 70 then decrease your next dose of Lantus\nby 2 to 4 units.\n\nShort-acting insulin: Novolog\nTake 16 units of novolog with breakfast, 6 units with lunch, and 10 units with supper\n(called standing dose) within 15 minutes of starting eat your meals. Do not take\nstanding dose if not eating.\nNovolog starts to work in 15 minutes and lasts about 2 hours. It peaks in about 1 hour.\nYou need to eat enough carbs to cover this insulin or you will have a low blood sugar.\nIf blood sugar is < 80 take your standing dose or sliding scale. If < 60 do not take standing\ndose.\nTake Novolog sliding scale (below) in addition to standing dose Novolog at mealtime\nIf Blood sugar is 125 - 150 take 2 units more\n150 - 200 take 3 units more\n201 - 250 take 4 units more\n251 - 300 take 6 units more\n301 - 350 take 8 units more\n>351 take 10 units more and call MD if blood sugar has not\ndecreased or has increased after 2 hours.\n\nBedtime High Blood Sugar: If your blood sugar at bedtime is greater than 200 take Novolog by the sliding scale below in addition to Lantus. Do not mix the two insulins. Do not take standing dose insulin at bedtime. Have your blood sugar checked 1 to 2 hours after taking novolog at bedtime to make sure you haven't gone too low. If you are below 80 then have a snack and juice to hold you over until morning.\nIf bedtime blood sugar is 201 - 250 take 2 units\n251 - 300 take 3 units\n301 - 350 take 4 units\n\n\n\nPlease follow up with your endocrinologist or primary care practitioner in 1-2 weeks. Bring this paper and your blood sugar results from the time you were discharged. For urgent problems or questions about your blood sugar or insulin call 387-8267 and ask for the page operator. Have beeper #68537 paged (the diabetes specialist on-call will call you back if you leave a message). You may also try my pager anytime (30568) but I am not always available.\n\nOlive Tripp, ACNP, CDE\nDixmont State Hospital\nDiabetes Management Service\n\n\n* Record date: 2084-06-12\n\nVIGIL, ANTHONY 40984972 06\/12\/2084\nJoshua A. Root, M.D. Nutfield Surgicenter 980 Westwood Dr, Suite 8466 Bangkok, NJ 53591\nDear Dr. Root:\nWe had the pleasure of seeing this patient today in followup of his transplant of 03\/25\/2084. He is doing quite well. There are no exertional complaints of dyspnea or chest discomfort. He is taking his medications without problems and denies fever, cough, rash or diarrhea.\nHe tells me his blood pressures at home are as high as 140-160 in the morning systolic dropping to the 130 systolic in the evenings.\nHis current medications are unchanged and include Neoral 125 mg b.i.d, prednisone 15 mg daily, CellCept 1 g b.i.d, aspirin 325 mg daily, Bactrim double strength one tablet every other day, calcium and vitamin D one tablet b.i.d, diltiazem CD 240 mg q.a.m. and 120 q.p.m, Lantus Insulin 20 units at bedtime, magnesium gluconate 500 mg b.i.d, multivitamin daily, Neurontin 100 mg t.i.d, NovoLog insulin p.r.n, nystatin elixir 5 mL q.i.d, omeprazole 40 mg daily, Valcyte 450 mg daily, vitamin C 500 mg b.i.d, and vitamin E 400 mg b.i.d.\nOn exam, he looks great. His blood pressure is 166\/98 initially, 148\/82 on repeat. His heart rate is 110. He weighs 163 pounds. His head and neck examination is unremarkable. His venous pressures are less than 7 cm of water. The lungs are clear. The cardiac exam reveals a tachycardic rhythm with no rub, murmur or gallop. The abdomen is unremarkable. His numerous surgical wounds are well healed. His extremities are warm without edema.\nElectrocardiography is notable for sinus tachycardia at 108 beats per minute, some nonspecific ST changes. He underwent right heart catheterization and biopsy today. His right atrial pressure was 5. His wedge pressure was 17. His PA pressures were 40\/20 with a mean of 30. The biopsy results are pending at the time of this dictation.\nIn summary, the patient is doing well now six weeks after cardiac transplantation. We will be making changes to his immunosuppressive regimen as dictated by the results of his blood work and biopsy. It is very gratifying to see how well he is doing. We will be sure to update you on a regular basis.\nSincerely,\nGlenn V Baxter, M.D.\n\n\neScription document:2-6397786 SFFocus\nCC: Amir Naranjo M.D. Boys Town National Research Hospital 3 Kelly Street Bangkok, NJ 53591\nDD: 06\/12\/84 DT: 06\/12\/84 DV: 06\/12\/84\n\n* Record date: 2087-03-09\n\n\n\nVIGIL, ANTHONY 40984972 03\/09\/2087\n\nAmir Naranjo, M.D. Saint Josephs Hospital Of Atlanta 4 Kelly Street Bangkok, NJ 53591\nDear Dr. Naranjo:\nWe saw Anthony Vigil in the Internal Medicine at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03\/09\/2087. He underwent orthotopic heart transplant at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03\/30\/2084 and returns now for his annual evaluation. In the interval since last seen, he has done reasonably well. His last annual evaluation at Lorain Community Hospital revealed an ejection fraction of 55% by echocardiography and no coronary disease, although left anterior descending was tortuous. Filling pressures were normal, then with a wedge of 15 and a right atrial pressure of 9 while the pulmonary artery pressure was 30\/19 with a mean of 25. The patient does have a herniated disk at L4 and stenosis at L5. He has lower extremity cramps, which potentially due to his spine disease have been markedly exacerbated by Pravachol. The Pravachol was therefore stopped, restarted, and stopped again. He continues to take insulin and his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.6. He has had two recent episodes of mild hypoglycemia. He has had no dermatologic evaluation. He denies angina, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias.\nPhysical Examination: Reveals a weight of 183 pounds, blood pressure of 121\/71, pulse of 100. Jugular venous pressure is 8 cm of water. Carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits. There are diminished breath sounds in the left lung. Point of maximum impulse is not displaced. First heart sound is normal, second crisp and clear. He has an S4 at the left sternal border. The abdomen is without hepatosplenomegaly. There is no peripheral edema. Peripheral pulses are diminished.\nThe electrocardiogram reveals a right bundle-branch block pattern with an intrinsic rate of 98 beats per minute. There are nonspecific T-wave changes particularly in the early precordium.\nCurrent Medications: Calcium with D 1250 mg twice per day, Cardura 4 mg, CellCept 1000 mg twice per day, diltiazem CD 240 mg twice per day, Ecotrin 81 mg per day, Lantus insulin 26 units at night, magnesium oxide 400 mg twice per day, vitamin, cyclosporine 100 mg twice per day, Neurontin 100 mg twice per day, NovoLog insulin as needed, prednisone 5 mg per day, vitamins C 500 mg twice per day, and vitamin E 400 units twice per day.\nImpression: The patient will undergo his annual evaluation over the next 24 hours. This will include blood work, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, metabolic exercise stress test, cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography, and endomyocardial biopsy. We will see him after completion of these studies and review the results with him. We will transmit the results to you as well at that time.\nSincerely,\n\nMichael P Rasmussen, MD\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-4411667 IFFocus\nCC: Joshua Root M.D. Bloomfield Care Center 724 Westwood Dr Bangkok, NJ, 53591 Fax: Email:\n\nCC: James Ingles M.D. Lorain Community Hospital 88 Cote Avenue Phnom Penh, NJ, 71738 Fax: Email:\n\n\nDD: 03\/09\/87 DT: 03\/09\/87 DV: 03\/09\/87\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2064-03-26\nMOUNTAIN SIDE INTERN ACCEPT NOTE\nPatient: Isenberg, Michael MRN: 3674193 Date of Admission: 25-March-2064 PCP: Dr. Charles Uher (DSH) Attending: Julian Quintela\/Micheal Leyva CC: Chest pain\nHPI:For full details, please see SDU Admission Note of 3\/22\/64 and SDU transfer note of 3\/25\/64. In brief, the patient is a 81 y\/o man with CRI, Type II DM and hypertension who was in his USOH until Thursday evening, when he developed substernal chest pain around 7pm, associated with dyspnea, but no radiation diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting. The pain lasted approximately 15-20 minutes. EMS was called, who brought him to the HCC ED, where he was found to be tachypneic, with an O2 of 85%. His pain was alleviated with IV NTG, and BiPap improved his O2 saturation. He was found to have an interventricular conduction delay and a positive troponin. He was begun on aspirin, lopressor, lasix, heparin, and integrelin and sent to the cath lab, where he was found to have 3-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous interventions. He was sent to the SDU, where he was started on lasix 60IV BID and a CABG pre-op workup was begun. Since admission to the SDU, he has been stable, with excellent RA sats. His Troponin-T peaked at 2.91 and was slow to return to normal, 2.65 on last draw today. He was diuresed aggressively and transferred to the floor with no oxygen requirement, having no chest pain. On the floor, he was stable but had a 15-beat self-limited run of MMVT, his BP was 110\/60 and he was asymptomatic, with no chest pain or dyspnea. He was given 4 gm iv of MgSO4, 60 mEq of KCL.

As you know, this is an 81 year-old man with a history of chronic renal insufficiency and diabetes. He underwent an off-pump double bypass on 3\/31\/64. He had an excellent post-operative recovery being discharged on day five. Since home, he reports having no further symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain. He has been gradually increasing his daily activity and is now walking about five to ten minutes a day and two flights of steps. I have suggested that he gradually increase his daily exercise.\n\nOn examination today his heart rate was 80 and regular. His chest incision was well healed and his sternum stable. His lungs were clear bilaterally. He had mild edema at his right ankle and a well-healed endoscopic vein harvest site.

He recently underwent a two vessel CABG in April 2064. At that time he had presented to HCC in CHF and w\/ an NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the LAD and LCx territory and moderate disease in the RCA. He underwent CABG on 03\/31\/2064, off-pump, w\/ a LIMA to the LAD graft and an SVG to the circumflex OM. His post-operative course was uncomplicated. He presented to DSH on 8\/14 w\/ SOB, found to be in CHF (BNP 482). He denies any chest pain and at DSH he had no ischemic EKG changes but was found to have positive cardiac biomarker w\/ an initial TnI of 0.6 rising to 23.8 o\/n. His biomarkers continue to rise and on transfer were CK 745 and CK-MB of 80.3 with a fraction of 10.7%. He was transferred to HCC where he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated continued severe disease in his native vessels as well as significant stenosis of his LIMA at its touch-down and complete occlusion of his SVG. A PA line and an IABP were placed and the patient was transferred to the CCU for further management.\nPMH \/ PSH: CAD S\/p 2-V CABG off pump in 4\/64 CHF- EF 38%, mild MR, diffusely hypokinetic LV w\/ apical aneurysm, RVSP 46mmHg, upper segment septal hypertrophy w\/o evidence of obstruction on TTE on 3\/24\/64 HTN Hyperlipidemia DMII CRI- Baseline Pcr is between 1.6-1.8\nMedications: Plavix 75 mg qd Aspirin 325 mg qd Lipitor 80 mg qd Lisinopril 2.5 mg qd Atenolol 25 mg qd Fluoxetine 10 mg qd\nAllergies: NKDA\nFHx: Mr. Isenberg s father died at 63, and his mother at 69, neither from cardiac causes.

Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm. A CTA done yesterday to evaluate his thyroid was read as:\n\nHematoma around right subclavian artery. Narrowing of the artery. Apparent filling defect, most likely artifactual. If thrombus is of clinical concern, upper extremity ultrasound may be obtained.\n\nOn physical examination, he has mild non expansile hematoma of the right chest wall. His right hand is warm and well perfused, with 1+ radial and brachial pulses. There are no thrills or bruits.\n\nMy review of arterial components of the CT show the following:\n1). Hematoma- to be expected\n2). Diffuse arterial calcifications- obscures the ability to read what is or is not in the lumen.\n3). Venous contrast bolus delivered on the right side- obscures our ability to discern the anatomy in the area of the subclavian artery.\n4). Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy.\n\nBased on his clinical exam, and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant, a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order. This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm. If there is an intraarterial filling defect, I would not pursue it. He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable. There are no stigmata of atheroemboli.\n\n\nUriel A.

She is a 77-year-old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 100-pack years quitting approximately eight years ago. She suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD. She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain, and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine. She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler. With these treatments, her dyspnea improved, but would worsen as the steroids were tapered. She does report some episodes of chest heaviness, which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest, which will last for minutes at a time. These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week. She was placed on Nexium with some improvement, but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes.\n\nTo further evaluate her symptoms of persistent cough and shortness of breath, she underwent a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolus. This was performed on 05\/20\/2101 and did not show any evidence of PE, however, there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery. There was a focal 9 mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery. She was then referred to me for further evaluation.\n\nPast medical history:\nHypertension.\nHyperlipidemia.\nGlucose intolerance.\nLeft bundle branch block.\nDiverticular bleed.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease.\nHypothyroidism.\nCOPD.\n\nCurrent Medications:\nprednisone taper\nhydrochlorothiazide 50 mg qd\npotassium chloride 10 mEq qd\nlisinopril 30 mg qd\naspirin 81 mg qd\ncalcium supplement 600 mg qd\nlevothyroxine 25 mcg qd\nLipitor 10 mg qd\nCelexa 40 mg qd\nalbuterol inhaler; Dir: and nebulizer\nmultivitamins\n\nAllergies:\n\nAllergy She reports receiving Halothane gas remotely with the development of jaundice at the time of her hysterectomy.\nDrug allergy Halothane gas, which caused hepatitis per her report.\n\nFamily history:\nNotable for her father with myocardial infarction at 54. Mother with an enlarged heart, who died at 82.\n\nSocial history:\nShe quit smoking eight years ago, previously smoked two packs per day for 35 years. She lives alone but her daughter lives above her in the same building.\n\nReview of systems:\nShe denies any significant change in weight. She has intermittent headaches relieved with Advil. She reports chronic cough and wheeze, which has been improved on prednisone. She has shortness of breath with exertion but denies exertional chest pain. No lower extremity edema, palpitations, or dizzy spells. She reports her reflux symptoms are improved on her Nexium. She has no history of stroke, no history of anemia. She reports her sugars have been diet controlled. Otherwise extended review of systems was negative.\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-Pulse: 70\n-BP: 142\/70\n-General: She is an elderly woman in no distress and comfortable at rest\n-Skin: Free of rashes\n-Heent: benign\n-Neck: JVP was at 5. She had 2+ carotids without bruits\n-Chest: Lungs are clear without significant wheeze\n-Cardiac: Regular, S1 and S2 without murmurs\n-Abdomen: Soft with a nontender reducible ventral hernia\n-Extremities: She had no edema in her extremities with 2+ distal pulses\n-Neuro: She is alert and oriented\n-weight: 185 pounds\n\nEKG:\ndemonstrated sinus rhythm at 70 with a left bundle branch block.\n\nAssessment and plan:\nGabrielle Oreilly has multiple risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a positive family history, and heavy tobacco use in the past. She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare, which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy. Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm. I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study, and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high-risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan. She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.\n\nPlan:\n1. Adenosine MIBI to evaluate for ischemia in distributions of the left system as well as the RCA aneurismal segment.\n2. Treatment of her emphysema as per your office.\n3. I will see her again in follow up in one month and consider cardiac catheterization for further evaluation.\n4. I have instructed her to proceed to the emergency room with the development of any significant chest pain or progressive shortness of breath.\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\nprednisone taper\nhydrochlorothiazide 50 mg qd\npotassium chloride 10 mEq qd\nlisinopril 30 mg qd\naspirin 81 mg qd\ncalcium supplement 600 mg qd\nlevothyroxine 25 mcg qd\nLipitor 10 mg qd\nCelexa 40 mg qd\nalbuterol inhaler and nebulizer\nmultivitamins\npotassium supplement 10 mEq qd\nAlbuterol Nebulizer\n\nIt is a pleasure to share in her care and I will continue to keep you updated.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nWendy Tapia M.D.\n\nSigned electronically by Wendy Tapia M.D. on Jun 17, 2101\n\n\n* Record date: 2102-01-07\nOreilly, Gabrielle #9868572\nPulmonary Consult by Dr. Trujillo for management of PE\nI have seen and examined the patient and agree with the history including HPI, PMHx, Meds, All, Family Hx, ROS; Pexam, labs, studies, assessment and plan as per Dr. Chavez.\nBriefly, 78 YO female with recent hip fracture in 8\/01 (not surgically repaired) who did well until 3 days PTA when she developed sudden onset CP, non-productive cough and was noted to have RA sat of 89%.

Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA (though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing) and that +cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality. Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion. Can change to low molecular weight heparin.

The patient was seen in conjunction with the resident, Dr. Simmons. Please see her note for explicit details of the visit. The patient was in his usual state of health until yesterday, when he noticed increasing shortness of breath with exertion, dyspnea, and diaphoresis and had an episode of chest pain radiating to his left neck. The episode recurred this morning. The patient presented to his primary care physician, who referred him to the Emergency Department for evaluation. Upon presented to the Emergency Department, the patient was pain-free and symptom-free, denying shortness of breath, fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Normal. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. NECK: Supple. CHEST: Clear. ABDOMEN: Soft. LABORATORY EVALUATION: EKG showed no significant changes when compared to old EKGs. There was some confusion regarding ST elevations, but they were due to lead placement. Troponin was 0.42. CPK was 175. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: The patient received oxygen, nitropaste, aspirin, and 2 mg of morphine in the Emergency Department with complete resolution of his symptoms. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Rule out MI. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): The patient will be admitted to the hospital. Condition upon admission is good.

The\nhistory briefly is as follows. This is a 51 year-old male who was\nrecently discharged from the hospital here after a successful\npercutaneous lithotripsy and nephrostomy placement. He presented\nthis evening for a leakage from his nephrostomy tube which he\nbelieves may have become dislodged or had its cap removed when he\nwas sitting on the sofa and got up. He has been leaking\nserosanguineous fluid since earlier today. He has no fever,\nchills. No other complaints.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes diabetes, hypertension, CAD, high\ncholesterol.\nMEDICATIONS: He takes hydrochlorothiazide, Zestril, Calan, Zocor\nand Levaquin.\nALLERGIES: He has no allergies to medications.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his family.\nFAMILY HISTORY: He has no significant family history.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature is 99.2, heart rate 93,\nblood pressure 136\/81. He is an awake and alert male in no acute\ndistress. HEENT - Normocephalic, atraumatic. Oropharynx clear.\nNeck is supple. Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nCardiovascular exam is regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub\nor gallop. Abdomen is soft, nontender. Mildly obese. Skin is\nwarm and dry. Left flank is with some resolving ecchymosis. No\nobvious subcutaneous fluid, and the area around the nephrostomy\ndrain is intact. His gurney linens are soaked with serosanguineous\nfluid. Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.\nNeurologically alert and oriented. Cranial nerves II-XII are\nintact. No motor or sensory deficits.\nCONSULTATIONS: He is seen in consultation by the Urology Service\nand his tubing was cut back and cap replaced. It is unclear as\nthis was placed by Radiology exactly the exact\nconfiguration of the tubing. However, it appears to have ceased\nleak at this time.\nDISPOSITION: He is discharged in satisfactory condition with\ninstructions to return for return of symptoms or for any other\nconcerns, and to call to have follow up arranged for early next\nweek.\nVJ645\/69473\nULICES ELLIOT, M.D. UE57 D:07\/19\/25\nT:07\/19\/25\nDictated by: ULICES ELLIOT, M.D. UE57\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2131-05-30\nEDVISIT^22267708^JONES, URIEL^05\/30\/31^COOKE, FREDI\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 67 year-old male was seen in\ntransfer from Friends Hospital for evaluation of progressively\nworsening shortness of breath over the last 2 days, associated\nwith increased fatigue and episodes of chest pressure yesterday.\nHe did note increase weight for the last 1-2 months,\nprogressively worsening shortness of breath with minimal\nexertion. He did have chest pressure at rest yesterday, which\ndid radiate to his left shoulder. This seemed to resolve\nspontaneously and then he noted shortness of breath with any kind\nof exertion at all. The shortness of breath was exclusively\nexertional. He has not noticed nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,\npresyncopal symptoms or diarrhea. No fevers. He does have a\nslight cough that is nonproductive. He was seen at a local\nEmergency Department today where he had laboratory studies as\nwell as was given Lasix, albuterol, and nitroglycerin and states\nhe has some relief of his symptoms associated with this. He was\ncardioverted 2 days ago for atrial fibrillation by his\ncardiologist at SAH. Additionally, at the outside Emergency\nDepartment, his INR was therapeutic at 2 as he is on Coumadin,\nbut his troponin was elevated at 0.16.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension, orally\ncontrolled diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial flutter.\nHe has had a cardiac catheterization last in 2127.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He is a past smoker with 10 pack years of\nsmoking.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As noted in the written chart and HPI,\notherwise negative.\nMEDICATIONS: Coumadin, citalopram, metoprolol, lisinopril,\nglipizide, Cipro, and simvastatin.\nALLERGIES: He is allergic to penicillin.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 99, pulse 63, respiratory rate\n20, blood pressure 140\/86, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.\nHEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic. Pleasant, calm. Neck is\nsupple. Respiratory: Clear to auscultation, except for\nscattered rales in the left lower lung field. Cardiovascular:\nRegular rate and rhythm without murmur. Abdomen is soft and\nnontender. Skin is intact, warm, and dry. Extremities: He has\ngot 1+ edema of the bilateral lower extremities that is\nsymmetric. Neuropsych: He is oriented x3, moves all extremities\nequally.\nLABORATORY DATA: ECG shows a sinus rhythm at 65 with poor R-wave\nprogression, but no acute ST segment abnormalities. Chest x-ray\nshows interstitial increased markings with a small left pleural\neffusion and prominence of the ventricle consistent with mild\npulmonary edema. Cardiac biomarkers show troponin of 0.16 with\ncreatinine of 1.43, CK-MB of 3.2 with normal index, and CK of 87.\nBNP is still pending. INR is 2.5, which is therapeutic on\nCoumadin.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: At the outside Emergency\nDepartment, he did receive Lasix and he put off approximately 2\nliters of urine since then with significant symptomatic\nimprovement in his dyspnea. He has no further episodes of chest\npain or pressure. I did discuss the case with Dr. Davison,\nthe SAH cardiologist on-call. I believe this patient has CHF\nexacerbation. He also was recently cardioverted, which\nexplain his troponin elevation. Additionally, his CHF\nexacerbation alone could explain his troponin elevation, and I\ndoubt the patient has an acute coronary syndrome. At this point,\nthe patient is already anticoagulated by virtue of being on\nCoumadin. We will hold any further heparinization or Lovenox at\nthis time. However, he will have serial cardiac biomarkers, will\nbe admitted to the Cardiology Service for evaluation and for\nfurther evaluation and optimization of his congestive heart\nfailure and for monitoring of his troponin levels.\nDIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure exacerbation, troponin\nelevation, and diabetes.\nDISPOSITION: Admission in stable condition.\n\nCOOKE, FREDI M.D.\nD: 05\/30\/31\nT: 05\/31\/31\nDictated By: COOKE, FREDI\neScription document:0-8412167 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2133-08-02\nStallworth Rehabilitation Hospital\/Newport Bariatric Surgery Program Postop Nutrition Assessment\nPatient: Uriel Jones DOB: 1\/7\/74 Date: 8\/2\/33\nSurgeon: Dr. Black Surgical date: s\/p gastric bypass 5\/11\/33\n\nS:\nHx: Pt was seen by his request with his wife.

He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and, I believe, Dr. Inglis. He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning.\nHis episodes of chest pain are interesting. He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching. The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset. They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge. He is otherwise in fairly good health.\nPast medical history: 1) Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatosis 2) Palpitations 3) Rotator cuff surgery in 2071\n\nAllergies: No known drug allergy\nMedications (Confirmed):\naspirin 81 mg po daily penicillin VK 500 mg po 4 x day\nFamily history: Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack. He has four siblings, all in good health.\nSocial history: He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health. He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine.\nHabits: He has never used street drugs. He does not smoke tobacco. He drinks 6 beers\/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.\nReview of systems: Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.\nPhysical examination: -BP: 110\/70 -Pulse: 59 BPM regular -resp. rate: 16 unlabored -Skin: without lesions or nodules. -HEENT: EOMI. PERRLA. Sclerae are anicteric. Conjunctivae noninjected. Mucous membranes moist. No oropharyngeal lesions. -Neck: carotids 2+ without bruits; jugular venous pressure <5 cm of water; thyroid without nodules; trachea midline. -Chest: lungs clear to auscultation, resonant to percussion, and symmetric in expansion. -Cardiac: regular with a normal S1\/S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. -Abdomen: soft, nontender, without organomegaly or other masses. -Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. -Neuro: reflexes were 1+; cranial nerves 2-12 were intact; motor and sensory modalities were intact in all four extremities.\nEKG: 10\/28\/2078: Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise the tracing is within normal limits.\nAssessment and plan: Mr. Martin has episodic palpitations associated with some chest discomfort. Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se. It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic, notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past.\nWe will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a 30-day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed.\nI will certainly keep you informed about how things progress.\nYours truly,\nNorman C.

At his last visit we gave him a 30-day loop event recorder for arrhythmia surveillance due to palpitations. Since that point he has transmitted events showing rapid atrial fibrillation up to 160 Bpm associated with chest discomfort, jaw pain and chest thumping. These episodes occur on a random basis and last up to 45 minutes. He does not identify any precipitating factors and symptoms resolve spontaneously. He denies dyspnea, PND, orthopnea, lightheadedness, pre syncope or syncope. He reportedly has had a negative stress test and echocardiogram. He is not on any medications.

We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. We have discussed treatment options including rate control, rhythm control or pulmonary vein isolation. We have scheduled him for nuclear stress test to R\/O ischemia given his symptoms of chest discomfort and new onset of atrial fibrillation and will send him for echocardiogram to R\/O structural heart disease.\nWe have had a long discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and if his diagnostic testing is within normal limits he would like to possibly consider this as an option for treatment. We have started him on Toprol XL 50 mg daily. If his diagnostic testing is within normal limits we will proceed initially with starting Class IC antiarrhythmic for the treatment of his atrial fibrillation. We will continue a discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and continue medical management. He has a CHAD2 Score of 0. We will therefore recommend treating with Aspirin 325 mg daily for prophylactic embolic protection and would not recommend coumadin at this time.\nWe will complete diagnostic testing, follow up with the results and then proceed.

As you know, he is a 52-year-old male with recent history of palpitations discovered to be atrial fibrillation. Episodes have been associated with chest discomfort, jaw pain and chest thumping and we therefore had him complete nuclear stress test and echocardiogram to R\/O structural heart disease. He is on Toprol XL 50 mg and aspirin. SESTA MIBI completed January 5, 2079 after 11 minutes, 13 METS and 90 MPHR was positive ischemia by ECG demonstrated by 2 mm ST depressions in leads II, AVF, and V6 and 2.5 mm ST depressions in leads III and V5. Myocardial scans showed mild anteroseptal and apical ischemia with EF 66%. He had no symptoms and there were occasional VPCs and PACs. Echocardiogram was normal with exception to mildly dilated LA 40 mm.\nSince his last visit he has had two additional of episodes of atrial fibrillation with complaint of rapid heart action, jaw pain and chest discomfort. The episodes lasted approximately 10 minutes and were relieved by rest. He denied lightheadedness, dizziness, pre syncope, syncope, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.

He understands and has agreed to proceed. We have also discussed treatment options for atrial fibrillation. He continues to be interested in CRYO Ablation. We have had a long discussion in this regard. We will have to start medication therapy first and then proceed accordingly. His medication options are now limited due to ischemia. Sotalol is the best option at this time.\nWe have spoken to Dr. Nagle who has agreed to complete his catheterization on January 24, 2079.

She was seated at breakfast this AM when she developed sudden onset ripping chest pain which radiated &#8220;like a knife&#8221; to her upper back. It was associated with nausea but no vomiting or diaphoresis or shortness of breath. It did radiate down both arms, but she her arm pains are now new. It was not relieved by any positioning, or largely affected by taking deep breaths. It tapered off over about 20 minutes. She felt fatigued and layed down, when it occurred again several hours later, again lasting for about 20 minutes. She then presented to DCA-ED for evaluation. She had a negative adenosine MIBI at JMH in 2078.\n\nShe has had a difficult time recently, she is under evaluation for a lupus-like syndrome (she has noted positivity for ANA, anti-smith, anti-dsDNA). She has had progressive joint and muscle pain of all of her major joints (ankes, knees, hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, lumbar back) and the muscles of her arms and legs. She endorses progressive mental &#8220;cloudiness&#8221;, frequently dropping items like cutlery and cups, and increasing tremor in her hands.\n\nDCA ED Course:\nInitial EKG NSR without ischemic changes\nInitial biomarkers strongly positive with CKMB 33 and Troponin 0.36.

Since I last saw Ms. Law, she underwent a 3-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery, internal mammary to the left anterior descending artery, free right radial graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex, and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery. She tolerated the surgery quite well and had a short rehab stay. Currently, she is doing some walking, but is still feeling quite tired and a bit deconditioned. However, her breathing does feel better than prior to the surgery. She has some residual sternal wound pain, but it has improved since her discharge.\n\nCurrent Medications:\n1. Aspirin 325 mg daily.\n2. DuoNeb.\n3. Diltiazem 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.\n4. Furosemide 40 mg p.o. daily.\n5. K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. daily.\n6. Metolazone 2.5 mg daily.\n7. Toprol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n8. Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily.\n9. Furosemide 40 mg p.o. daily.\n10. Colace, ferrous sulfate, ibuprofen, senna.\n\nAdverse Medication Reactions:\n1. Azithromycin.\n2. ACE inhibitor, cough.\n3. Latex, angioedema.\n\nOn physical examination, heart rate 81, blood pressure 106\/75, and weight of 246. In general, she is well appearing, in no apparent distress. Jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water. Carotids are 2+, no bruits. The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion, a well-healed median sternotomy, regular rate and rhythm. No significant murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses, bruits, organomegaly. Extremities: 1-2+ edema.\n\nReview of labs dated 05\/28\/2134, potassium 4.3, creatinine 0.9, ALT 16, AST 16, total cholesterol 125, triglycerides 106, HDL 36, and LDL 68.\n\nIn summary, the patient is a 62-year-old woman status post CABG, doing well. She does appear to be mildly volume overloaded today, therefore I will make the following medication adjustments. As far as her cardiac meds, they will change to aspirin 81 mg daily, potassium 20 mEq daily, Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d, metoprolol succinate 100 mg p.o. daily, and pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily.\n\nI will titrate her Lasix on an outpatient basis to have her lose 5-7 pounds to improve her shortness of breath as well as her edema. We will ask VNA to draw labs as well.\n\nI will see her again in 2 weeks' time. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.\n\nWarmest regards,\n\n\n\nAnthony Uphoff, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:8-77995324 IFFocus\n\n\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2137-12-17\nHIGHLAND HOSITAL VISIT PT: Ellen Law date of visit: 12\/17\/2137\ncc: fu DM, HTN, CAD, and pre-op evaluation\n\nHPI: Ellen is scheduled to have R cataract surgery on 1\/16\/2138.

Patient is undergoing high-risk procedure and is also at increased risk for VTE given cancer dx. According to guidelines from ACCP:\n#UFH 5000 Units SC TID [or LMWH >3400 Units SC QD (her CrCl <30, therefore renally dosed = LMWH 30mg SC QD)] to be started either in PACU or on the floor. #Compression stockings #Pneumo-boots #Plan to continue VTE prophylaxis for 4-6 weeks post-op #Encourage ambulation as soon as tolerated (per ortho, pt might be ambulatory as soon as tomorrow)\n(2) DM Patient recently started on insulin at home. Will continue half dose of home insulin with IVF with glucose. #RISS, until tolerating POs, then restart normal insulin.\n(3) Dispo Plan to D\/C when clinically stable post-op.

Following the diagnosis, he was discharged to Bellaire City Hospital, where he continued to experience falls. After one episode, he was forcibly picked up, and began to have L shoulder pain thereafter. He also noted a cut over the L elbow on transfer to the NH that was slow to heal. After several weeks of worsening shoulder pain, erythema, and warmth, he was re-hospitalized at Ouagadougou, where he underwent L shoulder aspiration. MRI 10\/87 demonstrated complete rupture of the rotator cuff, with associated large joint effusion. Of note, he denied fevers, chills, or NS.\nL shoulder aspiration 10\/10\/87 demonstrated purulent fluid, with 2,800,000 WBC (97%PMN). Gram stain demonstrated GPC in clusters. He subsequently underwent L shoulder I&D 10\/12, with removal of 300cc of frankly purulent fluid. He was started on cefazolin. Culture results returned a pan-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolate (including to ampicillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, penicillin, rifampin). Blood cultures were negative. He was taken back to the OR 10\/16 for arthroscopy, with extensive debridement. Interop findings included demonstration of significant fibrinous tissue, with no normal-appearing cartiledge present. A penrose was placed into a large cavity down the subdeltoid rescess, and a second in the subacromial space. He was transitioned to ampicillin 2g q6 hours x 2 weeks, and then given amoxicillin (either 1g BID or 500mg TID, unsure which) x 2 weeks.\n\nRepeat R shoulder MRI obtained 12\/12\/87, which was reviewed with staff radiologist, and demonstrated again complete tear of the supra\/infraspinatus\/teres minor\/ subscapularis\/ biceps tendons, with also persistent large joint effusion, extensive synovitis, and full thickness cartiledge loss of glenoid and humeral head. Also noted was possible AVN of medial portion of the humeral head. Overall, was difficult to tell from MRI whether findings represented prior vs active disease.\n\nMr. Moss was seen in the ID clinic 1\/18, at which time he complained of a several week h\/o progressively worsening L shoulder discomfort with activity. He did not experience shoulder pain at rest, and had not recently noted erythema. No drainage. Appetite was near baseline, though he had experienced fatigue. Blood glucoses had been well controlled. His daughter in law brought in extensive data on his home vital signs, which revealed absence of fever except for a single isolated temp of 103, with stable pulse\/BP, and overall well controlled blood sugars.\n\nDate ESR CRP\n12\/6\/87 88 23\n12\/19\/87 96 28\n1\/18\/88 67 9.4\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. Moss sustained a mechanical fall 1\/19. Following the fall, he had significantly increased hip pain. Hip\/pelvis films notable for femoral component with lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem. Orthopedic team felt that loosening of hardware would require another hip revision.\n\nROS: as per HPI. Denied having R hip pain prior to his fall.

The acetabular component demonstrates vertical inclination with evidence of polyethylene wear. The femoral component demonstrates lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem consistent with granulomatous disease. There is no subsidence or loosening based on Grauer's classification.\n\nAP chest film: no acute pulmonary process, probable cardiomegaly.\n\nAssessment: 77 yo M with DMII, CHF (EF 20-25%), afib, Parkinson's, prostate cancer s\/p XRT c\/b proctitis and GIB, multiple hip replacements, recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis (10\/87 - 11\/87) who presented 1\/19 s\/p fall. With regards to his shoulder, it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4-week abx course. Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam, 2 months after completion of his course, it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis. The MRI is difficult to interpret, and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes. He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers (though confounded by multiple comorbidities). Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection, our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically, off abx, for signs of recurrent infection. However, given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement, would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder. As such, would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics.\n\nThe source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated, and blood cultures were negative. However, such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding, and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected. This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening. Alternatively, he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls, or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca (?read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis).\n\nRecommendations:\n-hold antibiotics, including pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data\n-Aspirate shoulder. Send fluid for cell counts, Gram stain, aerobic\/anaerobic\/fungal cultures\n-if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement\n-would obtain hip biopsies in the OR, again off abx, to assess for possible hip infection\n-likewise, would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement\n-check CK, given elevated Cr following fall, and possible rhabdo\n\nThank you for this interesting consultation.

Hyperkalemia occurred on higher dose of Lasix. Apparently this has been a problem in the past. He also bumped his creatinine to 2.3. Potassium rechecked today and is now down to 5.1, stable creatinine. 2. Diabetes. Blood sugars running in the 80s in the morning, higher later in the day on 16 units of Lantus sliding scale to cover other meals. Uses regular insulin about twice a day. 3. GI bleeding ongoing by Mr. Moss's report, still having clots of blood, no abdominal pain, has not had GI follow up recently, is off Coumadin prior to shoulder repair. 3. Skin lesions, one on his left leg, one on his right medial leg and a lump on his back noticed by his daughter when she was giving him a therapeutic massage. 4. Left shoulder pain. Scheduled for surgery in the a.m.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is brighter, cheerier, acutely oriented. No acute pain. Vital Signs: Blood pressure 126\/57, pulse 66 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 161. Skin shows seborrheic keratoses, actinic keratoses on the right leg, papule with eschar on the left leg, a subcutaneous nodule on the right upper back. Chest is clear P&A. Cardiac exam regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, II\/IV apical systolic murmur radiating to the left sternal border. No gallop. Extremities, trace edema. Decreased ROM R shoulder. Abdomen soft.

He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in 2059 at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH. Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT. Apparently, he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3.53. He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this, admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments. The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan, all of which were negative. He has the reports here with him. The bone scan does show an abnormality at L5, but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion. He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis. This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him. He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week, however, is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done.\n\n\nImpression: In reviewing the patient's limited records that he brings and his history, it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH. I have reassured him of this, and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future. I also informed him that he will likely need anti-androgen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA. He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future.\n\n\nQuinton H.

HPI: Mr. Quin's oncological history begain in 2061 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (unknown gleason, PSA). He underwent radical prostatectomy in 2061 and salvage XRT in 2062. His care was at BNH and we don't have his XRT records. The patient recalls 37 treatments. The patient was well until he had an elevated PSA of 3.52 in 10\/75. He underwent a bone scan in 11\/75 showing worrisome uptake at L5. In 1\/76 he had a PSA of 17.46. He has also developed lower back pain requiring MS Contin for pain control. His course was complicated by a possible bladder\/urethral infection. He is incontinent from his surgery. In 2\/76 he had a cystoscopy which revealed nodules in the bladder (TCC vs. prostatic scar\/inflammation). The patient's LLP worsened. He reports occasional severe shooting pain that lead to gait imbalance. On the day of presentation, he experienced severe acute back pain while getting out of bed. The pain was so intolerable that he asked his daughter to bring him to the emergency room. Just before arrival to the ED he developed stridor, in his words he was sucking air in and out. ENT was consulted in the ED and determined that he had a limited glottic gap, and that the acute stridor was most likely secondary to anxiety and increased air flow through a restricted glottic opening, recommending humidified air by shovel air mask, steroids, and outpatient followup. MRI of the lumbar spine showed metastatic disease involving of the L4 vertebral body, extending into the pedicles, both L4-5 neural foramina, and the prevertebral soft tissues. No compression of the thecal sac.\nMr. Quin reports improved pain since admission. He still has some pain when moving from one position to anther. he denies fecal incontinence, saddle anesthesia, LE weakness or paresthesia. He would like to be cared at the LMH from now on. The patient had an oncologist from BNH but does not remember his name.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Prostate Ca (history per HPI) HTN PVD ED Type 2 DM on oral agent Vocal cord polyp excision in 2064 H\/o COPD MEDICATIONS: Bicalutamide 50 mg po qd Glyburide 10 mg po qd HCTZ 12.5 mg po qd MS Contin 30 mg bid Morphine 15 mg po q4h Senna Colace and lactulose prn constipation ALLERGIES: NKDA SOCIAL HISTORY: Notary.

The patient's LBP is likely due to his spine met. Based on the MRI results, his symptoms and his exam we believe he is an appropriate candidate for palliative radiotherapy to his L-spine. I discussed with Mr. Quin the likely cause of his pain. We then discussed the treatment options. Mr. Quin would like to undergo a course of palliative radiotherapy to relieve his pain. We will simulate (plan) the patient's XRT tomorrow am, with a treatment to follow on the same day. All of the patient's questions were answered to his satisfaction. We would also recommend an GU oncology consultation regarding the patient's ADT and other possible systemic therapies. The patient only had L-spine MRI, a bone scan may be of benefit to establish the extent of metastatic disease.\nQuenton Zacharie Odell, MD Quanita Ziemer, MD\n\n* Record date: 2076-05-04\n\nReason for Visit\npatient is here to establish primary care\nHe has metastatic prostate cancer and has completed 12 cycles of radiation to the back with good effect. Last PSA was 1.7. Is receiving Lupron every 3 months (after his 6 weeks pf Casodex).;\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness\nMr. Quin presented in 2061 with a PSA of around 4 and a prostate cancer of unknown clinical grade. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was performed in the BNH system, and disease extended beyond the prostate to the margins of the resection and into the seminal vesicle. In early 2062 he received adjuvant radiation. His PSA remained undetectable throughout the 2060s, but was troubled by a great deal of radiation cystitis with hematuria, frequency, and dysuria. In addition, he was totally incontinent. In 2071 his PSA was undetectably low.\nOver the last 8 months, he has developed low back pain of progressively increasing severity. His PSA back in September 2075 was approximately 3 and when checked in November was 17. Early this year his pain was of great severity, and repeat CT scans and bone scans were performed. Destructive disease was seen in the body of L4 with foraminal encroachment. The thecal sac and the cauda quina were, however, intact. He was started in early February on bicalutamide and was scheduled to have a Zoladex injection, but his pain became more and more severe, and ultimately he was admitted to the LMH last week where I first met him. Since admission he was started on urgent radiotherapy and has completed 12 cycles of radation with a last PSA of 1.7. He is due for Lupron injection on 6\/13\/76 at which time a PSA will be checked.\nHis oncologist Dr. Leblanc has helped him wean the MS Contin and tried to start adding low dose gabapentin as a narcotic sparing agent for presumed neuropathic pain. He is not requiring his prn pain meds very often.\nHe has claudication.\nHe has symmetric leg edema worse right after lupron injection and improved with TEDS. No chest symptoms.\n\n\nProblems\nProstate cancer\nPlan as above\nClaudication : has buttock pain when walking which resolves when stopping. He has decreased pulses in his DPs bilaterally and has a h\/o smoking and diabetes.\nDiabetes mellitus type 2\nchecks his sugars infrequently. He is on glyburide 10 am 5 pm. He had his eyes checked by an opthalmologist recently and no evidence of retinopathy was present. He has no early satiety, blurry vision, polyuria polydipsia, foot ulcers, chest pain, shorteness of breath, but does have some claudication. He is not on an ACE- inhibitor, takes HCTZ for BP control and has had hematuria from aspirin.\n\nPast Medical History\nas above\nsee CAS note\n\n\nFamily History\nsee CAS\n\nSocial History\nSee cas\n\nHabits\nhe has stopped smoking. good social support\n\nReview of Systems\nPositives noted in problem list.

Pain- I think he has a component of neuropathic pain. I think that we will start low dose neuronitni 100 tid for 7 days, he will email me about how his pain is and we will cut his pm MScontin in half if we can. I do not want to have to use exteremely high doses of gabapentin to spare narcotics because he is not a drug seeker and I want him to be comfortable and he has no congnitive problems with safe adminstration or dosing. His PSA is low and will continue to follow. If his pain is at night which sometimes it is, he could have a component of restless legs from arterial insufficiency, will check PVRs anyway to rule that out\n2. Cluadication- check PVRs, most likely has bilateral iliofemoral disease. He does not want to take aspirin given hiematuria in the past. I will broach this issue next time again\n3. DM- will email me his sugars and will adjust oral agents as necessary. He needs U\/a for microalb, eas encourgagd to wear shoes in house, will check PVrs, will start low dose lisinopril for BP and prevention of diabetic nephropathy and heck creatinine and K one week after starting the medicaiton. Will check lipids. Will continue to monitor BP.

She denies a history of heartburn, gastric or duodenal ulcers or GI bleeds. She has trouble falling asleep and staying asleep because of the burning pain in her feet. She is being referred to us by Dr. Ebert from Neurosurgery after an MRI scan showed spinal stenosis at L5-S1 and at L4-5 as well as spondylolithiasis between L4 and L5.

Her main problem is burning in her legs and feet, also present in her hands. She also reports an increased frequency of her chest tightness, occuring mainly at night, sometimes before going to sleep, sometimes durign the night. This is responsive to 1 SL TNG typically, although sometimes is goes away without intervention. She denies SOB, PND, orthopnea, presycope or syncope. She has intermittant mild LE edema. She occasionally has palpitations, lasting ~ 5 minutes, resolving spontaneously. She cannot relate them to any time of day or activity, and they are not associated w\/ lightheadedness or CP.\nRecently she called me w\/ complaints of increased LE edema. This is minor on exam.

Her last stress test was in January 2082 and was without ischemia with a posterobasal scar (Adeno MIBI). A recent echo in June 2081 done to evaluate increased LE edema was normal.\nProblems:\nCoronary artery disease - She reports an increased frequency of her nighttime CP and takes SL TNG when with good relief. Takes it about once\/month. These episodes only occur at night when she is in bed. Her echo showed preserved LV function and no significnat valvular disease. A repeat adenosine MIBI was negative for recurrent ischemia with an inferobasal scar and LVEF 54%. I advised her to take an H2 blocker before bedtime and if symptoms don't improve, seek a workup with her PCP.\n\nHyperlipidemia - Her last lipid profile showed that her LDL was in range at 67, and her TG were normal! I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise. Continue her present dose of statin.\n\nHTN - Her BP is well-controlled today.

So, I had him back today to discuss diabetic management and also review his general health in terms of his diabetes and his other medications.\n\nWe went over his medications to start with and he is taking them exactly as it was shown in the computer. These include atenolol 25, Glucotrol 10 twice a day, Actos 45, Lipitor 40 a day, Lasix 40 a day, and Procardia XL 60 mg q.d, and Coumadin. He is followed by Dr. Itzel Jaimes for his cardiac problems and by a diabetologist at the Claiborne for managing his diabetes.\n\nHe had no other complaints. His bowel movements are regular. He still has nocturia x3 and was recently seen by a urologist who felt there was no need for any intervention.\n\nHe otherwise was in good spirits and has no immediate complaints.\n\nHis social situation, his allergies and and his family history and past medical history, are overall as previously recorded. There are no other pertinent findings in the review of systems.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His blood pressure was 140\/60. He looks well. I did not measure his weight. His heart rate was around 64-68. His pupils are equal and reactive to light and extraocular movements were full. Mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue were normal. Lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation. Cardiac exam showed regular sinus rhythm, a normal S2 and no significant murmurs. Liver and spleen were not palpable. He had only 1+ peripheral edema which is less than usual.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: He seems stable, I think the biggest problem is regulation of diabetes and I have asked him to get a hemoglobin A1c and to measure his blood sugar when he gets up in the morning and in the afternoon before he has supper. He will come back to see me in about a month's time to follow up on these issues. CAD is stable with pacemaker\n\nHGB A1c is 7.0, Hct is down to 31.6, epo 37, creatinine stable at 1.6, MCV 93.3.

He got my name from a nurse who works in the hospital. HE is a 58 year old white male retired Transportation Manager with a number of issues. 1) He had a cyst or a mass enlarge in his R submental region which was excised at the McCook Erie Clinic. Note from his surgeon there said the path showed nonkaziating granuloma. I hope cultures are pending. The patient does volunteer at a homeless shelter so could certainly be exposed to TB or atypical mycobacteria. 2) The patient has know mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation followed at the MEC by a cardiologist. He had a stress test in the last year that was benign. Never had CHF or endocarditis. 3) Social situation. The patient is a sober alcoholic and sober for the last 2 years however he went through divorce probably because of his alcoholism 10 years ago and took early retirement from Brookdale Metro Systems because of his alcoholism. He stays sober by going to meetings and also volunteering at the McCook Clinic. He lives with a woman. He has good relations with his grown children and his grand children. His woman friend is very supportive and the patient is now feeling good enough about himself that he is ready to try and get work full time. Previous attempts to do so have resulted in failure because of his Hx of alcoholism and his premature retirement. Family Hx. Father died at age 79 of Altzheimers and some kind of cancer? throat cancer. His mother had diabetes and coronary artery disease and she died of colon cancer. The patient himself had a colonoscopy within the last year and it was normal. One brother and 2 sisters, one of the sisters also has mitral valve disease. Past medical Hx the alcoholism and he was stabbed in the L hand I think in 2059 and that was repaired. He also had a TNA in childhood. He has no known allergies to medications. The only medication he takes is Lisinopril 5 mg for blood pressure. He was only started on this in the last year. He also takes a vitamin a day. His other significant medical complaint is erectile dysfunction. He has normal libido and good sexual drive however he tends to lose erection after he has gone for a few minutes. He can achieve vaginal penetration. His live in lover has been supportive but she would like him to have better performance and so would he. He does wake up in the morning frequently with erections. He has no known Hx of diabetes. No prolonged hypertension or vascular disease. Social Hx. The patient eats fairly well. He walks usually a mile or so a day. He does not do any aerobic activity. He does smoke to a pack a day and has for many, many years. He does wear seat belts when he drives and does not do any elicit drugs. On system review: Weight stable. No change in skin. He always had a very gravelly voice. He has had no change in his vision. He is very deaf in the L ear. He has a morning cough no hemoptysis. Cough is about a teaspoon of white\/gray sputum. He has no dyspnea on exertion. He has no angina. No palpitations. No presyncope or syncope. NO claudication. He has no dysphagia. He has no epigastric discomfort. No change in his bowel movements and no rectal bleeding. He has no claudication. No edema and no joint pains. No headaches and no low back pain. No long bone pain. He has no heat or cold intolerance. He has no easy bruisability. PE: shows him to 5'7. 155 lbs. Skin benign. Nails do show some early clubbing. No cyanosis. Normal no AV knicking. Flat disks. Pupils equally round and reactive to light and accommodation at 3 mm. Nares normal. TMs normal. Hearing is markedly diminished in the L ear. Head is normal cephalic. Thyroid not enlarged. There is the scar at the site of his excision under the mandible. No associated adenopathy on either R or L neck or axilla or the supraclavicular region. He is hyperesonant to percussion. He has distant breath sounds. No rales, rhonchi or wheezes. He has normal S1. Normal S2 and holosystolic blowing 2-3\/6 mid systolic murmur radiates best to the axilla. No radiation to the clavicles. No carotid bruits. Jugular venous pulsation to 7 sonometers. Abdomen is soft and non tender. There is no enlargement of the liver. No adeventitious masses. There is a L inguinal weakness without frank hernia. Phallus uncircumsized. Testes normal. Prostate is a little difficult feel because he has a band around the anal sphincter which makes it difficult for me to get beyond but I felt probably half of his prostate and it was normal and smooth. Stool was guac negative. Reflexes 3+ and equal throughout and normal vibratory sense and touch. Normal gait and station. Assessment and Plan: 1) Recent rapidly growing mass under the R mandible showing nonkaziating granuloma. Culture is pending and we will plant a PPD and control early next week. I will have him tracked down the report of this from the MEC and get culture reports and will get chest x-ray today both for his COPD to rule out a cavitary lesion. 2) Alcoholism now sober. 3) Erectile dysfunction try Viagra. He was given appropriate warnings and instructions. I gave him 100 mg # 7. 4) Mitral valve prolapse by auscultation followed by cardiologist at the MEC. 5) We spent a long time talking about smoking cessation. He has some Wellbutrin at home from when he was depressed while getting sober and I encouraged him to take 150 b.i.d. and we made a plan for him to try and quit. I will see patient again next week to plant a PPD and then see him again in about a month to see how he is doing. We will certainly check the chest x-ray to make sure he did not have active cavitary disease. Leroy X. Oshea, M.D. * Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n* Record date: 2085-05-27\nMr. Ostrander is here for follow-up of his thyroid situation, however due to scheduling difficulties he is only having his thyroid uptake and scan currently. He took the tracer and he had his first scan now and the testing wont be done until tomorrow. Thyroid function tests were completely normal. His chest x-ray is completely normal except for tracheal deviation I believe which is due to his goida. I talked to him that if the nodule were cold we will need a fine needle aspirate. I also said to him that he made need to see a thyroid specialist. Though slightly anxious he is agreeable to this. He did not bring with him the pathology final report of his lymph node biopsy but he was told it was a reaction to an infection and no further follow-up or treatment was necessary. We then talked about smoking cessation and he and his live-in have picked a date namely Jun 8th to quit .I tried to give him as much encouragement for that as I could. Leroy X.

Given his exam, I would favor systolic heart failure > diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both. Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in 2092.\n\nI think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2\/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in 2092. His murmur is quite impressive. Another possibility is alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Ischemia is not out of the question given his age and risk factors. He is also a smoker.\n\nAnother possibility is diastolic failure given his hypertension and likely diabetes.\n\n1. CHF &#8211; Still quite volume overloaded on exam. Will give another dose of lasix 40 IV tonight. Start captopril 6.25 q8 to also control BP. Repeat echo in the am. Strict I\/Os, fluid restriction, low fat, low salt diet.

She has stable symptoms, nothing to suggest an ACS, but she's dyspneic with exertion and takes nitro occasionally.\n\nMedications: Atenolol 100 mg qd, Aspirin 81 mg. qd, Imdur 30 mg, Lipitor 20 mg qd, glucophage\n\nPhysical examination: Reveals her to be obese weighing 231 lbs. Her BP is 120\/ palp in her left arm and her heart rate is 80. Her lungs are clear throughout. Her apical impulse is non-displaced with a regular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and S2, but no S3 or S4. There is a grade 1 MR murmur noted. There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally with soft bilateral bruits. Her abdomen is morbidly obese. Her extremities are notable for trace lower extremity edema.\n\nEKG: NSR with an old IPMI. She also has non specific STT wave abnormalities. When compared to a previous tracing there is no change.\n\nImpression:\n\n1.CAD, s\/p cath and stenting: her angina is clearly related to her weight going up again; I worry about this, and wonder if she should have another weight loss surgery. For the meantime, I will increase Imdur to 60 mg qd, and consider an increase in atenolol.\n\nUmberto M. Uzzell, MD pager #12472\n\nSigned electronically by Umberto M. Uzzell, MD\nDocument Status: Final\n\n* Record date: 2089-04-05\nCARDIOLOGY\nSAINT VINCENT HOSPITAL\nInterval History: Ursula is seen in the Cardiology office for a followup visit. Since last seen, she notes a number of somewhat concerning symptoms. First of all, she is noting some mid sternal chest discomfort with exertion. She associates this with back pain related to a remote back injury, but nonetheless with exertions she develops some degree of mid sternal chest discomfort, non radiating, associated may be with some shortness of breath. She has not used any nitroglycerin for it. It gets better when she rests. She denies palpitations, PND, or orthopnea. Her sugars are out of control. Her weight is down, nonetheless.\nPhysical examination: -Pulse: 80 -BP: 130\/85 -weight: 206 lbs. -General: Overweight. Well appearing. -Skin: No rashes. Anicteric. -Heent: Unremarkable. -Neck: JVP less than 5, possible venous hums bilaterally. Carotids without bruits. -Chest: Clear to auscultation and percussion. -Cardiac: Apical impulse nondisplaced and discrete. Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and split S2. Soft S4 gallop. -Abdomen: Obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, dilated aorta. -Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\nProcedures: Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm IVCD, old IMI. In addition, she has nonspecific ST and T-wave changes. Compared there is no important change.\nImpression: 1. Coronary artery disease status post multiple PCIs. Ursula has the return of chest symptoms which are suggestive for angina. I will refer her for an exercise tolerance test to better evaluate this. I will continue on the current medication program. 2. Hypertension. Her blood pressure is a bit elevated. Given her diabetes, I think it is prudent to add an ACE inhibitor. Accordingly, lisinopril 2.5 mg QD was added to her program. 3. Lipids will be checked. I strongly suspect that her LDL is not well suppressed. Our goal LDL in this case is less than 70 mg\/dL.\nUmberto Uzzell, MD\nSigned electronically by Umberto Uzzell, MD Document Status: Final\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2063-12-31\nUHER,OLGA 258-16-49-2 12\/31\/63 CARDIOLOGY OFFICE NOTE NOTE Ms. Uher returns after a 4 year hiatus. She is now 52 and has long-standing insulin dependant diabetes with a h\/o retinopathy OS, possible peripheral neuropathy but not known nephropathy. She had a maximal negative exercise test in 2059 and has felt generally well since that time. Over the past year she has not been as careful as previously with her diet and has not been checking her sugars regularly. A random cholesterol w\/i the past year was over 300. She has intermittently had sharp, brief discomforts of the anterior chest lasting only seconds and not accompanied by dyspnea, diaphoresis or light-headedness. There has not been any reduction in her physical capacity, in fact, she feels stronger than a year ago and is working full-time. There has been no orthopnea, PND or peripheral edema. She is interested in increasing her physical activity program. Cardiac risk factors include remote smoking, stopped by age 20, hypercholesterolemia and family history in that her father developed coronary disease possibly in his 50's. She is perimenopausal and has discussed later estrogen usage with her gynecologist Dr. Bradley Brandt. Her only medication is lente insulin taken twice per day. EXAM She is comfortable at rest. BP 110\/76, HR 80 and reg. No JVD. Carotids full w\/o bruits. Chest clr. Cardiac exam shows normal heart sounds w\/o gallop or murmur. Abd. soft w\/o organomegaly. No peripheral edema. Resting EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis and is a normal tracing. For further evaluation of her chest discomforts and to help gauge her exercise program an exercise treadmill test was performed using the standard bruce protocol. She exercised for 9 minutes, 8 seconds and stopped because of knee discomfort but not because of chest pain or inordinate dyspnea. Peak heart rate was 143 (85% maximal predicted) with an appropriate rise in systolic pressure. There were no diagnostic changes of ischemia at this good work load. Compared to the test of 9\/15\/59 she exercised 1 minute, 4 seconds longer. IMPRESSION 1. No evidence of clinical coronary disease at this time. She has major risk factors of insulin dependant diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, family h\/o coronary disease and a perimenopausal state. She will be seeing Dr. David Yun as her primary care provider, and would urge that a fasting lipid profile be obtained and that dietary\/pharmacologic therapy be PAGE 2 UHER,OLGA 12\/31\/63 instituted to achieve an LDL cholesterol <130. From a cardiac standpoint, post-menopausal estrogen therapy would be desired. Low dose aspirin therapy could also be considered. I would be happy to see Ms. Uher for additional cardiac evaluation as needed in the future. REFERRING MD cc: David Yun, M.D. Ivan M.

Unfortunately she missed her entire appointment and did not bring her blood glucose log with her. She reports that at 4 a.m. last Thursday she woke up and felt disoriented with sweats. She checked her blood glucose, it was 50, and she treated herself by eating. This led to resolution of her symptoms, although she said that she overshoots. She has developed a foot infection, has been seen by a podiatrist and started on antibiotics. She has also been taking a thyroid hormone but she still feels that it is making her tired. She just in general has not been feeling as well as she had been previously. Past Medical History: 1. IDDM. Medications: See previous notes. Allergies: Same. Physical Examination: Not performed. The patient had a special orthopedic shoe on, her foot was wrapped. Impression: Patient with IDDM with usual blood glucoses in the 200's and an elevated A1C. Discussed the need for consistent meals and exercise and need for more control. Will increase day time insulin to 17 units of Lente and evening will stay at 10. She will follow up in one month. Will check a TSH today.

She is actually in the process of moving. She recognizes that she is improving, and is very excited about the fact that, during the course of the week, she went out to Sel de la Terre, and also went through a movie with her friend.\nHer sugars are still not well controlled. She has been liberalizing her diet, which I thought was appropriate. I did increase her morning insulin to 20 units of 30\/70, and suggested that she change from five units of NPH at bedtime to 8 units of 30-70, taken with her supper, to try to give her a little better coverage for her evening meal. I wrote a note to the nurse to actuate this change. They actually called me later in the evening, on page, and I discussed this with them, at length, at that time, including the rationale for this change.\nShe is not having any exertional or other chest pain. No orthopnea, PND or peripheral edema.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure is 135\/80. Heart rate 68 and regular. Respirations 14. Venous pressure 3. Clear chest. S4, no S3. No retrosternal dullness or rub. She has only a trace of ankle edema.\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: Her verbal skills have improved. She got very nervous when I tried to test her cognitive skills, and was able to give me the days of the week forward, but not backwards. I did not push her beyond that. I did tell her that we would need to check her TSH in a couple weeks' time, to see if last increment had returned her to a euthyroid state.\nSean Ugalde, M.D.\neScription document:7-829452 STeScription\nDD: 06\/27\/71 DT: 06\/27\/71 DV: 06\/26\/71\n\n* Record date: 2073-10-16\nEDVISIT^25816492^Uher, Olga^10\/16\/73^BALL, MILDRED\nThe patient was seen in conjunction with resident Dr. Sharp.\nThe resident's note reviewed.

Last BM was Thursday evening.\nThis is a normal spacing of her usual bowel movements. According\nto her visiting nurse, the urine looks dark. Blood pressure is\nrunning in the low 100 in the last month. Change in mental\nstatus for 5 days means that she is not as talkative as usually\nis.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nReviewed, confirmed, and notable for history of high cholesterol,\narthritis, insulin-dependent diabetes, retinopathy, renal\nfailure, foot ulcers, and hypothyroidism.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She was in an acute care facility as a nurse\ncoming regularly.

She has been to the emergency room multiple times for purulent drainage around her groin. She has been given multiple courses of antibiotics including Keflex and dicloxacillin. She is planning to have her disease surgically managed in the next few months. She most recently presented to the emergency room on January 7, 2079 with swelling and drainage of her hydradenitis in her groin. She was given a prescription of Keflex. Shortly after taking the first tablet, she developed itching in the hands, face, and legs and as well as hives. She denied any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or loss of consciousness. She called the emergency room and was instructed to stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic reaction. So now, she is here for follow up from that. She said shortly after stopping antibiotic her symptoms of hives and itchiness have improved very quickly. She is still complaining of purulent drainage around her groin.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes.\nMEDICATIONS: Glucotrol, Percocet as needed for pain.\nALLERGIES: She is allergic to erythromycin and now Keflex. She gets hives from both.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her left axilla looks dry. Her bilateral groins looks red, swollen tender with some serous as well as some purulent drainage. There is no fluctuance that I could feel.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Worsening of her hydradenitis. Given the recent allergy to Keflex, we will obviously need to take a different antibiotic. She has been on dicloxacillin in the past with good result. Despite the 15% cross allergy of dicloxacillin compared to Keflex, I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for now. If this does not work, I think one should consider clindamycin for treatment. I will go ahead and give her 14 days worth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M.D. if she develops any allergic reaction to this medicine. I also gave her 60 tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her prescription of Glucotrol XL 2.5 mg a day. She should see her PCP in two weeks.\n\n\nByron Pham, M.D.\nDictated By: Byron Pham\neScription document:9-3042267 EMSSten Tel\n\nDD: 01\/14\/79 DT: 01\/15\/79 DV: 01\/14\/79\n\n* Record date: 2080-03-24\nPICH CLINIC VISIT\nPT: Nora Greenwood\nDate of Visit: 3\/24\/80\nContact information: 715-007-3511\nId\/cc: 48F with PMH of type II DM, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hidradenitis suppurativa, and new diagnosis of fibromyalgia presenting to PICH for follow-up visit re: 1) DM; 2) HTN; 3) hidradenitis suppurativa 4) fibromyalgia\/joint pain.\nHPI: Interval hx to be reviewed by each issue.\n1) DM: Most recent HgbA1c on 12\/31\/79: 7.1 (down from 8.2). Nora reports fasting BS in the 140-150 and pre-dinner BS ~low l00's, but does not always check her FS on a regular basis. Noticed that her FS were running much high (>200) when she was taking the elavil for her fibromyalgia. She stopped the elavil bc of these elevated FS. Continues to take Glucotrol XL 2.5mg qd. Denies any episodes of hypoglycemia, but aware of possible symptoms and knows to keep candy with her at all times. Saw nutrition on 6\/5\/79 and feels that her diet has improved since this session. Continues to be quite active, walking a lot at her job (RN) and at home.\n2) HTN: Continues to take lisinopril 20mg qd; BP slightly elevated at last visit at 144\/68. Plan to repeat BP check today and if still elevated to increase lisinopril. Denies chest pain, SOB, DOE, LE edema, pnd, orthopnea, recent visual changes, palpitations, or headaches. Has been shoveling snow on a regular basis without sob or chest pain.\n3) hidradenitis suppurativa: Nora recently completed 14day course of levaquin for a flare of her hs. In past, treated with diclox and augmentin; however, nora felt that both became less effective with time. Also treated with Bactrim which was d\/c'd 2\/2 stomach upset. Feels that acute inflammation is better, but still with baseline, fairly severe inflammation, discharge, and pain. Had been seen by general surgery in the past who felt that she needed to be seen by plastics. Was scheduled to see plastics in consultation, but was told that she had to pay 200.00 for visit even though she was free care and could not afford this. Continues to use clindamycin topical gel. Denies fever, chills, night sweats, or n\/v.\n4) FIBROMYALGIA\/JOINT PAINS: Nora was recently seen in urgent care on 2\/13\/80 with c\/o diffuse joint pains and myalgias x 2 weeks. Urgent care w\/u included a negative ana, RF, and normal parvovirus IGM level, but IgG was 7.79% (normal less than 1.1). Seen by Dr. Marshall in Rheum who did not feel that she had a bona fide synovitis but considered ddx including fibromyalgia and inflammatory arthritis. Further work-up included a negative anti-ccp, normal EST, and a negative ASLO. He started her on elavil to improve her sleep, but nora stopped 2\/2 elevated bs.

Describes frequently missing meals; not eating breakfast. Continues to describe increased activity level. 2) Hidranitis suppurativa: Referred to general surgeon Dr. Iyer at last visit. Nora saw Dr. Iyer on 3\/02\/81 who felt that given the broad extent of the left axillary involvement, she would require extensive debridement and excision, and likely flap rotation coverage. He, therefore, referred her to plastic surgery. Feels that she needs abx again bc of increasing drainage and erythema. Cipro has been most helpful recently. Previously cultured and negative for MRSA. Today, denies fever, chills, ns, lightheadedness, increasing pain. 3) STD testing: Nora recently reported that her ex husband had told her that he had HCV while they were together but never told her. 11\/80 HCV ab negative. Completed further STD testing at last visit and HbsAg, HBsAb, TA-IGG, and HIV were negative. Still have not been able to check GC and Chlamydia bc Nora feels she can not undergo pelvic exam given HS in groin area. Denies any vaginal discharge. Not currently sexually active. 4) Shoulder\/Arm pain: See note from 2\/02\/81 for full hx details. Had MRI scheduled for 2\/9\/81 but unable to go through 2\/2 claustrophobia.

Suspect increased HgbA1c reflects recent cessation of metformin which Nora was not able to tolerate. Per her report, fasting AM FS appears most elevated, although random BG checked at last was 186. Asked Nora to keep a log of her FS, checking fasting, 2 hour post-prandials, and qhs FS on alternating days. ----increasing Glucotrol XL 2.5 mg qd to 5mg qd and suggested taking at night given elevated fasting FS, skipped breakfast but larger dinner, and daytime episodes of presumed hypoglycemia. ----once again reviewed the importance of regular, small meals given glucotrol; discussed considering switch to short-acting glucotrol Nora s slightly irregular food intake to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Will consider switch at next visit and with review of FS log. ----Asked nora to check FS during episodes of shakiness; will need to monitor closely given recent start of BB and concern that it may mask sx s. Discussed this w Nora and once again emphasized importance of regular meals on glucotrol. ----continue ASA 81mg qd, lisinopril 40mg qd ----2\/81 urine microalb\/crt: 62.8, above goal of <30 and likely due to persistently elevated BP. Adding additional blood pressure agent today (toprol XL) and will re-check malb\/crt once BP under better control. 2\/81 BUN\/CRT: 15\/0.7. ----will perform DM foot exam at next visit. Nora denies any numbness or tingling of extremities at this time. ----BP still not at DM goal of <130\/80; adding Toprol Xl 25mg qd to HCTZ 25 qd and Lisinopril 40 qd ----11\/80 (NON-FASTING): TCHOL: 189; HDL: 48, TRIG: 154, LDL: 110; on Simvastatin 80mg qhs. LDL slightly above DM goal of <100, but Nora has since attempted to increase exercise and eat low fat, low cholesterol diet. Rechecking lipid panel today. ----OPTHO: will need to confirm appt at f\/u visit 2) Hidranitis suppurativa: ----will confirm referral to plastics and schedule if necessary ----prescribing course of cipro given e\/o inflammation (less than previous flares) on exam today. 3) STD testing: Recent rpr, HIV, HBC, and HCV neg. Still not able to test for GC\/Chlamydia, but no sx s at this time to suggest infection. Will continue to offer, but again Nora declined given significant groin HS. ----recommended HBV vaccination and gave Nora green slip4) Left Shoulder\/Arm pain: Suspect multifactorial 2\/2 possible rotator cuff injury, biceps tendonitis, and adhesive capsilitis. Offered steroid inject at last visit, but Nora declined and continues to decline. ----will call about MRI results and consider treatment pnd results5) Pain control\/Narcotics log: Given increased use of short-acting percocet, started long-acting MS contin 15mg BID and encouraged use of percocet for break-through pain. No trouble w constipation at this time, but warned Nora of increased risk given daily use of narcotics and encouraged hydration and increased fiber intake. Also reviewed Narcotic log contract and conditions. Nora is aware of conditions and rules as well as risks\/benefits of chronic narcotic treatment. She agreed to drug testing today as well as all conditions described in contract. ----checking urine drug test today (Nora affirmed use of valium and percocet at 6:00am) 6) HTN: Still above goal of <130\/80 and with e\/o microablumin on 2\/81 urine test on HCTZ 25mg qd and lisinopril 40mg qd. Will add toprol XL 25mg qd today. Discussed possible side-effects including fatigue, mood changes, etc. ----scheduled f\/u with NP in 10d to re-check BP and HR; consider increasing dose if still not at goal and HR tolerates. Will also assess for development of any SE at that visit. ----TO DO: review sleep apnea ROS at next visit and will need to re-visit smoking cessation 7) Elevated AP: Suspect 2\/2 fatty liver (elevated GGT confirming GI source and RUQ w e\/o fatty liver) and asx at this time; continue RF modification (wt loss, strict lipid control). Will re-check in 6 mos (~7-8\/81). Consider GI eval if significant elevation or symptoms. 8) Panic attacks: continue tx through psych (CBT and valium prn). ----confirm f\/u appt w psych at next visit 9) +FH of ovarian cancer (mother, sister, maternal GM died of ovarian CA). Has had multiple previously scheduled appts to see high risk clinic at MTCI. Again offered to re-schedule for her, but Nora said that she had the number and was going to reschedule. Asked her to call me with date to confirm. 10) TOBACCO USE: Nora reported quitting at last visit but today smelled of smoke. Confirmed that she had restarted, ~ 4 cig\/day. Will need to discuss further at next visit and once again review crucial nature of smoking cessation for her. 11) HCM ----11\/3\/80 LIPID PANEL: (NON-FASTING): TCHOL: 189; HDL: 48, TRIG: 154, LDL: 110; rechecking today. ----PAP SMEAR: Pt overdue for pap; once again asked to defer given severe pain 2\/2 HS; will continue to offer; discussed my concern regarding continual deferral of pap and the risks that this posses. Nora states that she understands risks but feels that exam would be impossible given pain. ----MAMMOGRAM: Scheduled on several occasions, but never obtained bc of pain. Nora still feels that examine would be impossible given HS. Will continue to discuss and work to get treatment for her HS. Expressed my concern regarding continual deferral of mammogram and risk for cancer. Nora states that she understands risk but simply feels that it would be impossible given level of pain. I offered to give her pain medications but she still does not feel that she could undergo this test yet. Will continue to discuss with her. ----DV SCREEN: negative today; ex-husband again in prison. Previous h\/o abuse. Will continue to screen. ----Ca and VIt D: gave her PICH pt education handout regarding daily requirements ----SEATBELTS: + use ----OP: review OP RF at next visit TO DO: ----will need to review previous OPTHO findings; Nora mentioned that her opthomologist mentioned something I should know ; asked her to get phone number so I can call him to find out what she is referring to.

As you know, he recently had a complicated hospital course. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD including 70% and 90% stenoses. The first marginal branch had a 60% ostial stenosis. The right coronary artery had 60 and 80% stenoses, respectively. The PDA had a 70% narrowing. Given his very significant wish not to have bypass surgery, it was decided to proceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as the obtuse marginal. It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel, and not worth going after at this time. The RCA was successfully stented, but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left ventricular branch. By the end of the procedure, flow had been restored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch, but Mr. Potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial infarction. Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular branch, the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated. Mr. Potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure. The second exercise test was performed with MIBI imaging. He exercised for nine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol, and experienced chest pain. He had a maximal blood pressure of 148\/72 and a heart rate of 121. MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial infarction of the basal 1\/3 of the inferior wall. There was moderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the territory of the RCA. Given these findings, it was highly recommended that Mr. Potts undergo bypass surgery. Mr. Potts was discharged on aspirin, Ticlid 250 mg b.i.d, Atorvastatin 20 mg q.h.s, Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d, Imdur 60 mg q.d. He also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin. Of note is that Mr. Potts has been under quite a bit of stress recently. His 89-year-old mother has been at Whitehead recovering William Potts MR# 109-16-75-8 -2- January 5, 2070 from a hip fracture. He is having difficulty arranging the appropriate insurance to cover her medications. Mr. Potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge. This occurs with increased activity, and is relief with either rest and\/or 1 nitroglycerin. He has decreased his work level considerably, and is relatively sedentary. On physical exam, he was well appearing and in no distress. He had a blood pressure of 112\/70, with a heart rate of 60. His weight was 203 pounds. Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion. Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of 30 degrees, a nondisplaced PMI with a normal S1 and S2, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits. His abdomen is soft, nontender. There is no organomegaly, and no hepatojugular reflux. Extremities are without edema. Electrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 61. Intervals are .16\/.08\/.42, with an axis of -10 degrees. There are flipped T-waves in III and AVF. I did not have an old electrocardiogram here for comparison. Therefore, Mr. Potts returns today still experiencing angina with mild exertion. He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass surgery. He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work by his physicians, that the Screen Actor's Guild will make a good case for this. There has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to return to work as an actor. Given Mr. Potts's current feeling, I will make an appointment with Dr. Earl Jacob as soon as possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery. It is somewhat worrisome that Mr. Potts will be caring for his 89- year-old mother at home, along with his wife. His mother currently uses a walker, and I have warned Mr. Potts that he really cannot exert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in the house. He understands this, and if his chest pain should become more frequent, intense, or prolonged, he will immediately call me. If Mr. Potts is not scheduled for surgery, I will see him in two weeks at NDNH. With best regards.

Patient has not had to her knowledge a cardiac workup for this. Also had some vascular studies done at that time and was told they were normal. The patient is unclear on status of recent pelvic exam. GYN - G7, P7, still with uterus but not sexually active. Denies any change in bowels. Denies any change in appetite.\n\nThe patient has been complaining of animals crawling across her chest. States she used a cream for 1 week with resolution but now feels the animals are back, and she has been using a pesticide agent which sounds like a Kwell agent to resolve these.\n\nRecent testing - L-spine films confirm grade 2 anterospondylolisthesis L4-L5 with disc space changes at L1-L2. Negative allergy testing. 1\/1 immune globulin testing significant for an IgG of 15\/40 and positive ANA at 1:40 and 1:60. MRI of spine 12\/93 shows degenerative changes of lumbar spine. No evidence of disc herniation or canal stenosis. 11\/92 - Paranasal sinus films show no evidence of sinusitis. Mammo 3\/94 WNL. Carotid ultrasound done 12\/93 shows minimal disease of right and left carotid bifurcations. TCDs 12\/93 suggest a stenosis of the left vertebral artery with an RVA WNL. Velocity suggests a mild stenosis. EKG 12\/93 shows sinus brad with an LAE. No other significant changes. Nonspecific ST changes.\n\nO: HEENT - Unremarkable. Skin - No obvious sign of rash or infection where she states the animals are present. CV - BP is 170\/88. RR at 60. No murmurs, gallops, rubs present. Lungs - Clear to P&A. B12 was 331. Attempted Pap smear. External genitalia unremarkable. Vaginal introitus is very small. Patient got very cold and clammy and nervous throughout the tried Pap smear; so Pap smear attempt was terminated at that time. Consent was obtained to conduct Pap smear. Lungs - Clear to P&A.\n\nA\/P: (1) Dizziness of unclear etiology. Neuro consult had been done when the patient was hospitalized, and meclizine has not been of any benefit. Will refer patient to Vascular to ascertain whether the TCD findings are related.\n\n(2) Report of syncope. Will obtain stress test.\n\n(3) Chronic NSAID usage. Add ranitidine HCL 150 mg to 1 p.o. q.h.s. to regime. Patient will follow up with Dr. Helen Whitehead as her new PCP.\n\n\nFrieda Nadeau, RN, ANP\n\nFN\/warren\/forbes\n\n\n* Record date: 2094-09-28\n\n\nCHOL 210 (T) 244 (H) 243 (H) 256 (H)\nTRIG 50\nHDL 62\nLDL 138\nF\/u: CAD, LBP\nSaw Dr Mora of Cardiology, who she says kept her on ASA and SL NTG.

Patient has returned from her trip to Hong Kong. Says\nthat it was a bit stifling, because she cannot drive and was dependent on other people\nfor transportation.\n\nStill has severe right shoulder pain. Still also complaining of left jaw pain, that is\nworse when she has to open her mouth very widely. Reviewed x-rays, which were\nnegative for fracture of frontal facial bones, and did not reveal obvious abnormality in\nthe TMJ area. Has yet to receive an appointment from Dr. Vann for this\nshoulder pain.\n\nPatient was afraid to try the Vioxx, because she was told by the pharmacist that she\ncould not take it with ibuprofen. I explained to her that she should take the Vioxx in\nplace of the ibuprofen and she understands. Is not willing to try Flexeril.\n\nPatient spent approximately 20 minutes describing her dissatisfaction and difficult\ninteractions with her children. Has not asked for more Valium. Has never been\ninterested in counseling prior to today. Did not become tearful like she has in the\npast.\n\nAsked for refill of sublingual nitroglycerin. Prescription apparently was given to her\nlast spring. Complains also of upper chest wall tenderness. No clear to me what\ncauses her to take the sublingual nitroglycerine, but says when she takes it, it relieves\nher symptoms. I have asked her if this pain is ever exertional, or is the same pain\nthat is reproducible when she touches her chest. The patient seems to label her chest\nwall pain as the same as pain that she gets with exertion.\n\nPROBLEMS: As per LMR.\n\nMEDICATIONS: As per LMR.\n\nALLERGIES: As per LMR.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: WD\/WN female in NAD. Blood pressure 150\/80.\nPulse 80 and regular. Weight 152 pounds. Lungs: Clear bilateral breath sounds.\nCOR: RRR. S1 and S2 without murmurs noted. Extremities: No lower extremity\nedema. Soreness over posterior right upper trapezius. Full range of motion of\nshoulders. No tenderness over AC joints. Chest wall tenderness over superior aspect\nof sternum and its border on left. No masses or deformity noted.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\n(1) Chest pain: Certainly overdue for a follow-up with her cardiologist, Dr. Hunter\nMccarthy. Referral done. Also referred sublingual nitroglycerin.\n\n(2) Elevated blood pressure. Better than last visit, but remains slightly elevated.\nAt last visit, patient was reluctant to start a beta blocker. Think she may need\nthis at future visit. Will also refer back to her cardiologist.\n\n(3) Elevated lipids, last checked last year. Several medications that patient appears\nto be sensitive to side effects. At next visit, will give lab slip to repeat fasting\nprofile. Positive checkup. Would probably benefit from lipid lowering.\n\n(4) Leg cramps. Toward end of visit, patient also complained of more than 25\nyears of leg cramps. Unable to take quinine because of allergic reaction.\nPatient already takes Valium p.r.n. and I am reluctant to start any other\nanxiolytics. Will check electrolytes and calcium at next visit.\n\n(5) History of sciatica. Patient states in past that she has received steroid injection\nfor her lower back pain, which resolved. Will simply follow with Vioxx, which\nwill hopefully help other pains that patient is experiencing. Also continue with\nher rheumatologist, Dr. Solomon, who has followed her chronic fibromyalgia and\nchronic low back pain.\n\nReturn to clinic with me in six to eight weeks.\n\nADDENDUM: Patient's referral was receiving by Dr. Vann's office and they tell\nme she should be able to get an appointment for 6\/95.\n\nHelen Whitehead, M.D.\n\nHW\/warren\/stark\n\n* Record date: 2095-12-07\n\nNAME: Upham, Zelda MRN: 0308696\nThe patient is here for a scheduled visit, status post hospitalization for emergent bypass surgery. She is late for the visit. She is accompanied by her daughter, Qazi. The patient denies chest pain and has done quite well, based on reports from her rehab stay at the Miller County Hospital. Currently complaining of left-sided chest wall pain. No exertional chest pain and no shortness of breath. Has an appointment pending with her cardiologist tomorrow. Also has an appointment pending with surgeon Dr. Weeks for 12\/13\/95. Has been compliant with medications.\nThe patient's daughter is concerned that the patient is not eating enough. Has lost significant weight since hospitalization. Patient did agree that she has been watching what she eats because she did not want to gain much weight. Explained to her the importance of proper nutrition and getting back her strength.\nAsked if she can use an OTC pain patch called Salonpas. Says that the chest wall tenderness is very different from any exertional chest pain that she may have had in the past. Would like some relief for this. Uses it on her knees and finds it helpful for the arthritic knee pain.\nEmotionally, the patient did admit to feeling depressed and did become tearful during the visit.\nPROBLEMS: See extensive LMR list.\nMEDICATIONS: See LMR list.\nALLERGIES: Sulfa, Percocet and quinine.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well-appearing female. Vital signs: WNL, as per flow sheet. Lungs: Clear with rales. COR: RRR, S1 and S2 without murmurs noted.\nASSESSMENT:\n(1) CAD: The patient is also on a cholesterol-lowering agent, but will update list at next visit. Keep appointment with cardiologist.\n(2) Chest wall tenderness status post CABG: Tried to encourage patient that there will be some persistent discomfort in her wound for several months. Told her to hold off on using the OTC pain patch until I can verify the ingredients.\n(3) Depressed mood status post surgery: Refuses referral to Mental Health. Not suicidal. Encouraged patient to eat more regularly.\n(4) Return to clinic for follow-up in two weeks.\nThis visit lasted for 35 minutes, half of which was spent trying to counsel the patient to obtain proper nutrition and to go to Mental Health. I was unsuccessful in convincing her to attend a Mental Health session.\nHelen Whitehead, M.D.\nHW\/warren\/stark\n\n* Record date: 2097-08-18\n\nMSH Adult Medicine Office Visit PCP Dr Whitehead\n\n73 yr old woman with HTN, SP CABG, fibromyalgia comes in for follow up of renal MRA done for evaluation of renal insufficiency and associated high K.\nShe was hospitalized in 7\/97 for a fairly acute deterioration of renal function and hyperkalemia. At that time she was told to DC Lisinopril and Vioxx. Her renal function seemed to improve with that intervention though in early August her K+ rose a bit. The VNA has been seeing her at home. According to the patient her BP has been normal.\nShe and her daughter come in now to review results of the recent renal MRA. They are seeing me because there were no appts available for her with her PCP.\nShe denies any chest pain, shortness of breath. Appetite is good.\nShe has been trying to avoid foods high in potassium but she is not sure about K+ content of many foods.\nShe has been taking Lisinopril at the same dose since her CBG in 2095 and has been taking NSAIDs for fibromyalgia for several years.\n\nMedications\nAsa (ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID) 650MG TABLET EC take 1 Tablet(s) PO QD\nMvi (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 CAPSULE PO QD\nNtg 1\/150 (NITROGLYCERIN 1\/150 (0.4 MG)) 1 TAB SL Q5 MIN X 3\nMeclizine HCL 25MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO TID\nNeurontin (GABAPENTIN) 300MG CAPSULE take 1 Capsule(s) PO QHS x 30 days\nLipitor (ATORVASTATIN) 20MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO QHS\nAtenolol 25MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO QD, use pill cutter\nEffexor (VENLAFAXINE HCL) 50MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO QD\n\nProblems\nCoronary artery disease : Sesta mibi EST 7\/18\/94 positive for inferoseptal and mild septal ishemia.\nSP CABG X 5 2095\nLow back pain : MRI, LS spine 12\/05\/93;DJD, no spinal stenosis, o disc herniation.\nSciatica : Dr. Solomon follows.\nSyncope : etiology not clear;? fainting.\nAnxiety\nFibromyalgia : Dr. Solomon\nPain in joint : Mild degenerative changes at the rightacromioclavicular joint.\ngranuloma : RUL, stable\nAcute renal failure : off vioxx and ACE resolved, 7\/97\n\nProcedures\nCardiac bypass graft surgery: CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT TIMES FIVE (LEFT INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY TO LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING, REVERSED SAPHENOUS VEIN TO POSTERIOR LEFT VENTRICLE AND POSTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY, REVERSED SAPHENOUS VEIN TO DIAGONAL AND RAMUS INTERMEDIUS).\n\nAllergies\nPERCOCET - abdominal discomfort,\nCodeine - GI upset,\nSulfa - Rash,\nQuinine Sulfate - Unknown\nOxycodone 10 Mg\/acetaminophen 650 Mg - Unknown\nQUININE - LOC after dizzyness,\nROFECOXIB - RI,\nLISINOPRIL - Renal Toxicity\n\nPE: BP 140\/80 R and L arms sitting P 60 reg\nNo JVD.\nChest is clear\nCOR: RRR, no m, rub.\nNo edema.\n\nResults\nRadiology\n\nExam Number: 5998283 Report Status: Final\nType: MRA 3D\nDate\/Time: 08\/06\/2097 10:00 AM\nAssociated Reports:\n9899518: MRA Renal + & -\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHISTORY:\nRENAL ARTERY STENOSIS, ACUTE RENAL FAILURE\nDIAGNOSIS:\nEPPS\nREPORT\nEXAMINATION: MRA RENAL ARTERIES\nPROCEDURE: MRA of the aorta and renal arteries was obtained according\nto standard department protocol. 3D images were obtained and\ninterpreted.\nFINDINGS: The celiac, SMA and IMA are patent.

On 1\/31 he had symptoms similar to those he experienced prior to his MI in 2073: pain in back of left neck, left shoulder, and left arm. As a result he did not exercise that day. The symptoms improved spontaneously. On 2\/01 he did his normal exercise routine, running on the treadmill for 40 minutes; he felt fine. Later that day, he had recurrence of the symptoms so he called Dr. Ishmael's answering service. Dr. Patterson was covering and recommended he go to ED. He is very impressed that Dr. Patterson saw him that evening in the ED. There EKG showed no changes but troponin-I and CK screen were positive. He was admitted to cardiology service and managed with integrullin and heparin. When second set of enzymes was positive on 2\/02 he went to cath lab, where old RCA stent was pristine, LAD showed stable 50% lesion, but distal LCx showed 90% lesion. He had PTCA and stenting with medicated stent, producing excellent result. He was discharged on 2\/03 on plavix.\n\nToday, he says he has had no recurrence of symptoms. He is feeling great. He is concerned that he had the MI despite taking all his medications as prescribed and feeling so well with exercise. He wonders whether he needs to re-start cardiac rehab. He is avoiding exercise until he sees Dr. Ishmael next week.

He says it started Saturday with a tickle in his throat; he went to the race track on Sunday and felt the same; on Tuesday he had dry cough, occasionally bringing up clear sputum. He had no fevers but perhaps some mild sweats. He notes mild sinus congestion and post-nasal drip. No known sick contacts.

She presented to the Emergency Room 5.5 hours after last seeming normal. Her initial NI stroke scale was 11. She was admitted to the Neurology Service for a stroke workup. Her imaging studies showed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata, head of the caudate basal ganglia, and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA in addition to a left ICA occlusion. She was taken to angiogram for interventional neuroradiology. She had an angiogram. Radiology felt they were unable to access the cause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was admitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and hypertensive therapy. She remained stable anti-coagulated on heparin. During the hospital stay, she spontaneously converted to rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation, which was felt to be the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to remain anti-coagulated. She was discharged to rehab and subsequently went home from rehab on 08\/04\/2067. At home, she had been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been feeling O.K. VNA sees her once a week. At rehab, for unclear reasons, her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the discharging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic, this was done for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is unaware of any such problems. She continues to get PT and occupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory remains poor. According to the family member and her daughter who are here interpreting for her at Clinic today, she continues to have right-sided weakness, although significantly improved and decreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able to communicate well with her. Since her discharge, she has not had any new episodes of numbness, weakness, headaches, or visual changes.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She denies any fevers, chills, weight loss, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, leg cramps, claudication, dyspnea on exertion, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, heartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowel or bladder habits, rashes, arthralgias, myalgias, polyuria, polydypsia, breathing, or bleeding problems. Review of neurological systems as above.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol.\nMEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Zoloft, Zocor, and Captopril.\nALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in Castle Rock with her son. No history of tobacco or alcohol.\nFAMILY HISTORY: A sister had a stroke.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her blood pressure was 150\/80, her heart rate was 70, respiratory rate of 12. General: Pleasant woman in no acute distress. HEENT: Atraumatic, normocephalic, sclera anicteric, and oropharynx is clear. There is no thyromegaly. Neck: Supple, no bruits, with 2+ carotids. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Clear to auscultation. Abdomen: Has good bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Skin: No rashes or ulcers. Neurological exam (conducted via her daughter and the interpreter): She is alert and oriented. She is attentive. She is non-fluent with really minimal verbal output. She has decreased naming and decreased comprehension. She does not have any neglect or apraxia. Registration is 3\/4. Short-term memory is 0\/4 in 5 minutes. Pupils are 3 and reactive to 2 millimeters. Fundi are normal. Extraocular movements are intact with nystagmus. Visual fields are full to confrontation. She has a right facial droop. Facial sensation is intact. Hearing is normal. Motor exam: There is increased muscle tone on the right arm and leg. She has strength on the left is normal. On the right, her strength is at least 4\/5 in all muscle groups on the left on the neck, except for about 3\/5 in the distal arm. She reports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm. There is no ataxia on the left. Gait is slow, walks with a cane, and so conducts the right leg. Her reflexes are brisker on the right at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response.\nIMAGING DATA: Initial head CT on 06\/18\/2067 did not show any acute stroke or hemorrhage. On the CT, there was a question of a left MI cutoff. CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA stenosis with minimal distal interflow. MRI of the brain showed a left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata, head of the caudate basal ganglia. She has had mild to moderate chronic small vessel ischemic changes on her MRI. Echo showed a normal EF of 55% without any clot, no PFO.\nIMPRESSION: This is a 73-year-old woman with significant vascular risk factors, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory infarct. On exam, she has residual aphasia involving both comprehension and fluency; and a moderate right hemiparesis. It is unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her stroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during her hospital stay, I think that she would benefit from anti-coagulation therapy. I have asked her to get a follow up PCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are any contraindications to anti-coagulation. If there are no such contraindications, she should restart on warfarin. In addition, her blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask her to increase her Captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d. and to maintain a blood pressure diary.\nRECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Continue anti-hypertensive and increase Captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d. 2. Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment. 3. Continue risk factor modification with the management of blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterol as she is doing. 4. PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab stay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications per the PCP. 5. Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait training and language rehab. 6. Return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any new problems.\nMore than 50% of this clinic visit was spent on patient education and counseling.\n\n\nJordan Namari Akers, MD, PHD\nDictated By: Jordan Namari Akers\neScription document:7-1410500 VSSten Tel\n\nDD: 09\/16\/67 DT: 09\/16\/67 DV: 09\/16\/67\n\n* Record date: 2069-05-27\nMay 27, 2069\n\nChad Norwood, MD\n\n\nRe: Hannah Heath\nOCH #: 91156456\n\n\nDear Dr. Norwood,\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Hannah Heath, for consultation in the Vascular dept at the OCH.

She has a prolonged hospital course as well as rehab stay and now returns having made significant recovery. She is here with her family who is translating. She ambulates with walker, but does well over short distances without it. She communicates well with eth family and is able to feed and dress herself. She has an aid for bathing three ties per week. She has not needed the PEG tube in the past 6 months and is eager to have it removed.

She has had a significant recovery. Our goal should now be secondary stroke prevention and risk factor modification. Given that her bleed was a SDH and in the setting of elevated INR, it is worth considering restarting warfarin, until then, she should at least be on ASA and I have communicated this with them. She should continue with her BP and cholesterol treatment as well. She is eager to remove the PEG and I will refer her to Dr Queen for this. RTC as needed.

I confirm that I have\ninterviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's\ndocumentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the\nevaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.\nPlease see the resident's note for further details.\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Altered mental status.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old female\nwith history of prior strokes, hypertension, diabetes, and\nparoxysmal atrial fibrillation, who presents with altered mental\nstatus. As per report, the patient has not been acting like\nherself and not communicating or speaking like herself. The\npatient was in her usual state of health until a few days ago\nwhere she started to develop a cough as well as some chills. The\npatient's family members state that the patient has not been out\nof bed and has been unwilling to eat. The patient's family\nmembers state that the patient is not acting like her usual self.\nThe patient's family members deny noting the patient complaining\nof any nausea, vomiting, chest pain or shortness of breath. The\npatient was actually taken to clinic yesterday because the\npatient was starting to speak less. The patient was seen clinic\nand was thought to be depressed. The patient has a known history\nof a facial droop. The patient was incontinent of urine today.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient's vital signs reveal the\nfollowing: Temperature was 102.8, heart rate 110-160 beats per\nminute, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure is 144\/110, and\noxygen saturation was 95% on room air. The patient's oxygen\nsaturation was interpreted as borderline low. General: No acute\ndistress, multiple family members at bedside. HEENT: The\npatient's head was normocephalic and atraumatic, no scalp\nhematomas. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.\nMucous membranes were somewhat dry, right facial droop noted, no\ndrooling. Neck: Supple, no JVD, no carotid bruits appreciated.\nThere was no meningismus. Respiratory: Poor cooperation with\nexam. Fair aeration, no focal rhonchi, rales, or wheezes, no\nincreased work of breathing or use of accessory muscles was\nnoted. Cardiovascular: Irregularly irregular, tachycardic,\nunable to appreciate any gross murmurs, rubs, or gallops. GI:\nAbdomen: Soft, no rebound or guarding, prior well-healed prior\nG-tube scar noted. Rectal exam deferred. GU exam: The patient\nwas incontinent of urine. Skin: Warm and dry. No rash or\nlesions were noted. Back: The patient did not have any\ncostovertebral angle tenderness. There is no midline thoracic,\nlumbar, or sacral spine tenderness to palpation. Extremities:\nWarm and well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or asymmetrical\nlower extremity edema was noted. There were no palpable cords.\nNeuro: The patient was alert, the patient was a verbal. The\npatient grossly moved all 4 extremities with fair strength. The\npatient responded to touch appropriately. The patient was unable\nto cooperate with cranial nerve examination.\nINITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a 76-year-old female\nwith history of prior stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and\nparoxysmal atrial fibrillation, who presents with altered mental\nstatus and urinary incontinence. Differential diagnosis at this\ntime includes infectious versus a metabolic abnormality. The\npatient has no new deficits on neuro exam as per the family and\nas per review of prior notes. Repeat stroke is certainly on the\ndifferential, however, I have a lower suspicion then for a\nmetabolic or infectious etiology. The patient will need to have\na large workup including laboratory studies, urine studies, Foley\ncatheter, portable chest x-ray, and repeat noncontrast head CT\nscan.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: Upon arrival to the Emergency\nDepartment, the patient had history and physical exam performed.\nThe patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid\nventricular response. The patient's 12-lead EKG revealed a rate\nof 166 beats per minute, atrial fibrillation with rapid\nventricular response, stable T-wave inversions noted over the\nlateral leads as well as over the precordial leads. No definite\nST segment abnormalities were noted. The patient then had a\nportable chest x-ray and as per report, the patient's portable\nchest x-ray did not reveal any acute cardiopulmonary process or\nfindings. The patient did have a noncontrast head CT scan and\nthe patient's noncontrast head CT scan was notable for some\nright-sided edema. The patient will have this followed up with\nan MRI of the brain. The patient's laboratory studies were\nnotable for sodium of 131 and potassium of 5.2. The patient's\nlactic acid was 1.7. The patient's white blood cell count was\nnot elevated. The patient was not anemic. The patient's\nurinalysis was consistent with infection. The patient's first\nset of cardiac markers were negative. The patient's coagulation\nstudies were normal. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone\nfor her urinary tract infection. The patient could possibly have\nurosepsis given her fever and tachycardia. Urine sepsis is my\nleading diagnosis at this time. The patient's right-sided edema\nis certainly concerning, however, I do not feel that the patient\nwill need to be admitted to Neurology at this time. The patient\nwill be admitted to medicine for presumed urosepsis. The patient\nwill need to be admitted to a monitor bed. The patient's blood\npressure is normal, and as such, I do not feel that the patient\nneeds an intensive care unit bed. In terms the patient's atrial\nfibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the patient was\ngiven metoprolol IV. The patient was not given any oral\nmedications secondary to her possible stroke. The patient was\ngiven rectal Tylenol as well as rectal Kayexalate for her\nelevated potassium at 5.2.\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSES:\n1. Urosepsis.\n2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.\n3. Hyponatremia.\n4. Hyperkalemia.\nDISPOSITION: The patient was admitted to the Medicine and to a\nmonitor bed.\nCONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION: Stable, but guarded.\n\nYEAGER, CHRISTOPHER M.D.\nD: 03\/01\/72\nT: 03\/01\/72\nDictated By: YEAGER, CHRISTOPHER\neScription document:4-2135677 IFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2092-09-18\nEDVISIT^14477347^Bennett, Nancy^09\/20\/92^NOE, NATALEY KINSLEE\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Dizzy.\nI confirm that I have seen and evaluated this patient, reviewed\nthe resident's documentation, and discussed the evaluation, plan\nof care, and disposition with the patient.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 74-year-old woman with a\nhistory of diabetes and hypertension who for the last 24 hours\nreally has had trouble getting out of bed.

She has no focal deficits.\nShe had no fall, no fevers, no chest pain, no shortness of\nbreath, no abdominal pain, no nausea, no vomiting, and no\ndiarrhea. She is able to ambulate with a walker. She denies\nheadache. She was feeling well until yesterday. She had no\nrecent medication changes. She has chronic lower extremity\nedema, left greater than right. She has stable 2-pillow\northopnea. She is followed by Dr. Whitman of Cardiology. She\ntakes Lasix 80 mg twice daily among other medications and the\nstatus was stable. She had a normal cardiac stress test\napproximately 4 months ago.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She presents with a heart rate of 84,\nrespiratory rate of 16, blood pressure initially of 220\/90,\nsystolic pressure decreased to 175 without treatment shortly\nafter arrival, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air with\ntemperature of 98.5. She is awake and alert. She is in no acute\ndistress. She has moist mucous membranes. Her neck is supple\nwith full range of motion. She has mild left-sided facial droop,\nwhich she states is old. She has clear and equal breath sounds\nbilaterally and no respiratory distress. Heart is regular\nwithout murmurs. She has soft, nontender belly. She has\nasymmetric lower extremity edema with 2-3+ pitting edema to the\nleft and 1+ pitting edema to the right, which she states is\nchronic and unchanged from baseline. She has 5\/5 strength\nthroughout. She has no pronator drift. She is able to ambulate\nwith a walker.\nLABORATORY DATA: Basic laboratory testing shows an unremarkable\nCBC and Chem-7. A set of cardiac marker shows a troponin of\n0.06, which is decreased from her most recent baseline, which has\nbeen elevated over the past several months. Her BNP was 112.\nHer urinalysis was unremarkable. Her EKG was a paced rhythm.\nChest x-ray was unremarkable.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was discussed with Dr.\nWhitman who recommended the patient be admitted to the\nObservation Unit for another set of cardiac markers to\ntroponin as well as observation. He will see the patient in the\nmorning. If the patient's set of cardiac markers are not\nincreasing and she feels well enough to go home, she will likely\nbe discharged after Dr. Whitman sees her and makes any\nmedication adjustments that are necessary.\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Hypertension.\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Generalized weakness.\nDISPOSITION: Observation Unit.\n\nOAKLEY, ALBERT M.D.\nD: 11\/02\/97\nT: 11\/02\/97\nDictated By: OAKLEY, ALBERT\neScription document:1-98167165 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2093-07-13\nCCU JAR Admission Note\n\nName: Urban, Russell\nMRN: 4722064\nDate of Admission: 7\/09\/93\nPCP: Georgia\nCards: ward\n\nID: 50 y\/o man transferred to CCU for wide complex tachyarrhythmia\n\nHPI: 50 y\/o man with no PMH and cardiac risk factors of smoking and family history (father died of MI at age 41) who presented to the ED with chest pain.

At concert on day of admission, he was sitting at rest when he had sudden onset of crushing sub-sternal chest pain, 8\/10, no radiation, associated with mild SOB and marked diaphoresis. Pt reported some associated back pain with onset, like I was being crushed like a sandwich. Was not eating at time, not like heartburn, no fevers, chills, cough, or chest trauma. EMT was called-2 SL ntg relieved pain, was given ASA.\n\nOn arrival to the ED, he was chest pain free. His HR was 52-60 in normal sinus rhythm.

As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling unwell, epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis. He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time. By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated. He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction. That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia. He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management. The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall. Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive. He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system. This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery. A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall. He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0. A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093. This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic. His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease. Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern. He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.\n\nSince his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well. He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager. He has had no symptoms of angina, dyspnea, nausea, or diaphoresis. He has felt very well. He continues to take his medications without difficulty, and denies any symptomatology whatsoever.\n\nHis past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care. Of note, he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia, he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort. He was evaluated and released. He never had any further testing. He did not have a stress test, cardiac ultrasound or catheterization. Prior to his admission, he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital.\n\nHis medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day. He has no known drug allergies.\n\nMs. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports, Inc, he moved to Georgia where he lived for 24 years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions. He immigrated to America about a year or so ago. He has been working in Borders. He currently lives in Toledo, Montana, with his wife. He has no children. He smoked 1 to 1-1\/2 packs per day for about 30 years, but has not smoked since his hospitalization. He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use.\n\nHe has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease.\n\nOn physical exam, his blood pressure was 130\/82 mmHg in his right arm and 126\/80 mmHg in his left arm. His heart rate is 60 and regular. In general, he is in no apparent distress. His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water. His chest is clear to auscultation without rales, wheezes, or rhonchi. His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2. He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His abdomen is benign. His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits. His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits. His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization. The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse. His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout.\n\nHis lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of 210 mg\/dl, LDL of 153 mg\/dl, and HDL of 45mg\/dl.\n\nHis electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm. He has T wave inversions in III and aVF, and he has a greater than 15 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis.\n\nMr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday. He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS, and a peak double product of 21,600. His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia. His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction. There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere. His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.\n\nIn short, Mr. Urban is a 51-year-old who had an inferior myocardial infarction, but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease. Also, his systolic function has improved over time. I think there are two processes going on. One is coronary artery disease. Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery, which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting. The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease. Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this. He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one. I suspect that this is myocarditis. Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit. It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.\n\nFrom the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life. He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery, and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months. For his hyperlipidemia, I agree with Lipitor, and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate. His LDL goal will be less than 100. He is well beta-blocked on his carvedilol, and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily. His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily. I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup. I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman. The patient was seen and examined, and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville Ness.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\nJimmy Orozco, M.D.\n\nJO\/0564\nFI: 400908\nDD: 08\/19\/93\nDT: 08\/20\/93\n\n\n* Record date: 2094-05-11\nPatient Name: Urban, Russell\nPatient ID: 472-20-64\nProvider Name: Orozco, Jimmy\nDate of Visit: 05\/11\/2094\nVisit Type: Return Visit\n\n\nJohn Ussery, M.D.\nWorthington Internal Medicine\n28 Shattuck Street, IM 270\nCitrus Ridge, MT 43782\n\nDear Dr. Ussery:\n\nI saw Mr. Urban in follow-up in the office today. Since his last visit in November, he has been feeling well. He has had no angina, no exertional dyspnea, no shortness of breath, no orthopnea, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no palpitations, and no other symptoms of note. Since his last visit with me, he has participated in and completed outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. He found this program to be very helpful; he sis very well with the program. He is currently exercising on a regular basis and has no chest discomfort of dyspnea with exercise. He has stopped smoking. There have been no difficulties with his medications.\n\nOn 03\/16\/2094, he had a follow-up echocardiogram done; this study shows an LV ejection fraction of 37% with septal hypokinesis and inferoposterior akinesis; there is trace mitral regurgitation; and aortic sclerosis, but no stenosis. Notably, he has a right ventricular systolic pressure estimated to be 46 mmHg with a right ventricle that is mildly dilated and mildly-to-moderately hypokinetic. He has been feeling quite well and has no other symptoms.\n\nHis review of systems is as above and is otherwise negative in detail.\n\nMedications:\nAspirin 325 mg daily\nPlavix 75 mg daily\nLipitor 40 mg daily\nlisinopril 10 mg daily\nCoreg 6.25 mg daily.\n\n\nPhysical examination:\nHe appears quite well and is in no apparent distress. His blood pressure is 112\/60 mmHg and his pulse rate is 50 beats per minutes and regular. His JVP is 7 cm of water with no Kussmaul's sign. His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2. He has no S3 or S4 gallop and no audible murmurs. His abdomen is soft. It is neither tender nor distended. He has normal bowel sounds. His extremities are warm and well perfused. He has no edema.\n\nImpression: This is a 50 year-old man with coronary disease who suffered an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in July 2093. Additionally, he was also found to have cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of 37 percent. He is currently asymptomatic from his coronary disease and his LV dysfunction. Notably, his last echocardiogram shows that he has increased RV systolic pressure and some early right ventricular dysfunction. The etiology of this right ventricular dysfunction is not clear. There is likely a component of left heart failure. In addition, he may have right heart failure out-of-proportion to left heart failure: he has a longstanding smoking history and may have a degree of COPD and, lastly, he may have obstructive sleep apnea. He reports to me that he does snore at night, and his first wife in Georgia had told him for many years that during the night he had periods were he would stop breathing. This raises obstructive sleep apnea as a consideration.\n\nRecommendations: Initially, I am going to start him on Lasix 20 mg daily to lower his preload to help with any component of LV failure that is leading to this. The rest of his regimen is quite good, and I intend to continue them. To help to see if there is any component of cor pulmonale that may be contributing to this, I am going to obtain first a chest x-ray, secondly a pulmonary function testing, and lastly a sleep study. If indeed we find components of obstructive lung disease or obstructive sleep apnea, we will have him see a pulmonologist and treat these accordingly. I will see him again in six months' time.\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman.\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\n\n\nJimmy J.

He had a repeat ETT 7\/31\/95. EKG was positive for ischemia. Imaging showed a defect that was c\/w ischemia. His meds were adjsuted, but his symptoms have persisted.\nToday he presented for elective cath +\/- via SDA. Cath showed his RCA to be totally occluded, with 2 LCX lesions. His LCX was stented with 2 cyphers (3.5 x13 and 3 x 23) with good results. He was put on reopro and transferred to Cardiology where he arrived pain free and in no distress.\n\nPast Medical History\nCAD\ns\/p IMI, RCA stent x 2 2093\nCardiomyopathy\nCHF\nHyperlipidemia\nHypertension\nOSA\n\nAllergies\nNKDA\n\nSocial History\nMarried, lives with wife\nWorks in Borders\n\nHabits\nETOH: occasional social\nSmoking: 45 pkyr hx, none for 2 yrs\nCaffeine: 2-3 cups in am daily\nDiet: low fat, low chol, NAS\nExercise: was walking regularly until symptoms recurred\n\nFamily History\nFather with MI x3 at early age\n\nMedications\nAt Home:\n\nASA 81 mg QD\nLisinopril 10 mg QD\nCoreg 6.25 mg BID\nLasix 20 mg QD\nLipitor 80 mg qPM\nKlonipin 1 mg qPM\n\n\nPhysical Exam\nHeight: 73\nWeight: 182\n\nVS: 90-110\/60's, 50-60\nMonitor: SR\n\nGen: well appearing caucasian male in NAD\n\nNeuro: alert, oriented x 3, speech clear and articulate.

It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves. As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089. Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms. When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy. At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss. Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms. Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves. Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes. He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker. He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.\n\nFrom the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath. We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\nPast medical history:\nHypertension.\nHyperlipidemia.\nCAD.\nPAD.\nPrior tobacco use.\nObesity.\nType 2 diabetes mellitus.\nDepressive disorder.\nCervical spine disease.\nCongenital hypospadias.\nProstatitis.\nHemorrhoids.\nColonic polyps.\nChronic normocytic anemia.\n\nMedications (Confirmed):\n\naspirin 325 mg qd\nAtacand 15 mg qd\ndoxepin\nglyburide\nLipitor 80 mg qd\nLopid 600 mg BID\nToprol XL 50 mg qd\nWellbutrin\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-Pulse: 66 and regular\n-General: Mr. Mullen is well appearing in no apparent distress\n-Heent: Benign\n-Neck: Carotids are 2+ without bruits\n-Chest: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi, or rubs\n-Cardiac: Discloses regular rhythm with a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute. S1 and S2. There is no murmur, rub, or gallop\n-Abdomen: Obese, nontender, and nondistended. There are no masses or bruits appreciated\n-Extremities: Reveals 1+ right femoral pulse with audible bruits. Trace to 1+ left femoral pulse with audible bruit. Distal pulses are 1+ without any evidence of edema, skin breakdown, or ulceration\n-BP: 145\/80 on the right\n\nOther Data:\nThree-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery 2082.\nStatus post C6-C7 disk surgery 2079.\nHypospadias repair in childhood.\n\nAssessment and plan:\nMr. Christian Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip, buttock, thigh, and claudication.\n\nMr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related. Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089. On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis. We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes. Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e. CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted. Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus\/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.\n\nIt is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position. Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree. We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia. He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there. He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test. With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus\/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.\n\nParamount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130\/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss. We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\nglyburide\nToprol XL 50 mg qd\nAtacand 15 mg qd\nLipitor 80 mg qd\nLopid 600 mg BID\naspirin 325 mg qd\nWellbutrin\ndoxepin\n\nThank you for allowing us to participate in his care.

I also reviewed and confirmed the PMH, medications, social and family history, and detailed ROS. I personally performed a comprehensive cardiovascular examination, including assessment of VS; auscultation of carotid arteries, lungs, heart, and abdomen; palpation of carotid arteries, evaluation of jugular venous pressure, palpation of abdominal aorta and lower extremity pulses and perfusion, and neurologic examination for focal deficits. I interpreted the EKG and other pertinent laboratory data. I discussed findings with the patient and personally developed the management strategy and plans. My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above, with which I concur.

I permanently follow him for PAD, as I know he follows with Dr. Fernandes for his coronary disease.\nRegarding his peripheral disease, he is status post left common femoral endarterectomy, performed at my request by Dr. Fredrick Xa couple of years ago. This alleviated some of his left leg claudication, though he still has some residual symptoms in that left calf. The right calf is what bothers him more, with symptoms that are earlier in onset. They occurred about 100 yards of walking on the flat. While Chris is affected by this, it does not preclude him from doing his usual activities of daily living. He also continues to travel (on his way to Bogalusa with Brad Fair, his partner, next week), and also continues to work actively. The biggest problem with his claudication is that it prevents him from being physically active enough to lose enough weight. As he says, he put on about 80 pounds after his coronary bypass graft in 2082, and he has had trouble losing the weight. He is considering weight reduction surgery, but has not made a decision about this yet. He is struggling with the decision.\nI would support him either way in this regard, encouraging him to lose weight however he can do so.\nIn terms of his lower extremities, his exam demonstrates diminished pulses (absent to palpation) in both ankles, but they are audible by Doppler. Both feet are well perfused, with good capillary refill. He has no ulcers or gangrene.\nFrom a cardiac standpoint, Chris is doing well. He denies significant dyspnea or chest discomfort, although he is limited in terms of walking because of his legs. It has been 11 years since his bypass operation, and I think it would be reasonable to do a stress test on him to make certain that there is no evidence of silent ischemia. While this might be controversial, as to whether to do a stress test or not, my own gut feeling is that it is probably the right time in this patient with significant risk factors and limitations on the basis of his lower extremity disease. He requests specifically we do this study here, so I will take the liberty of ordering an adenosine MIBI, and certainly will forward you the results.\nOtherwise, Chris is doing great. We will continue to work on risk factor modification and I will see him again in six months. We will also order an exercise ABI and duplex of his lower extremities to assess where we stand at the present time. If his symptoms progress to the point where they are more disabling, then we would consider further evaluation. Otherwise, as long as his symptoms remain stable and his lifestyle is not terribly limited, we will continue the same.\nOther Data: I saw him today with Vernon Galvan, one of my cardiovascular fellows, who have written a detailed note. We will send this along to you as well.\nThanks again.\nBest personal regards,\n\n\nGuyton Nunes MD\ncc: Nathan Fernandes M.D.; Vernon X Galvan M.D.; V\nSigned electronically by Guyton Nunes, MD Document Status: Final\n\n* Record date: 2093-12-27\nCARDIOLOGY\nBEAUREGARD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\nReason for visit: 73 yo male admitted via CCL s\/p PTA to right profunda and CFA and stenting to right CIA and right EIA\nInterval History: Mr. Mullen is a 73 yo male with an extensive history of coronary artery disease (bypass surgery in 2082) peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and obesity,\nHis PVD includes: Left Common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization in 11\/88.

The patient reported that he was stuck in traffic for about 12 hours last night and apparently got very tense. He felt some heat from his car, thought that it was overheating, and then developed some chest pain and throat tightness. He really described what seems to be fleeting chest tightness and no diaphoresis, no shortness of breath, and no arm numbness or tingling. However, he did have one associated symptom of some throat tightness. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has had a stress test one year ago that was normal. He had an echocardiogram at that time that was also normal. MEDICATIONS: Claritin, Proventil, and cimetidine. ALLERGIES: Morphine sulfate. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: The patient is afebrile. Vital signs are normal. HEENT: Normal. NECK: Supple. LUNGS: Clear bilaterally. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur. ABDOMEN: Soft and non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Negative. No CVA tenderness. LABORATORY EVALUATION: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm. There is no change in his electrocardiogram. Chest x-ray is clear. CK is 155. Troponin is 0.13. Electrolytes are normal. BUN and creatinine are 20 and 1.0. Hematocrit is 39, white count normal. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: The patient is a 46 year old male with a fleeting episode of chest pain and throat tightness while stuck in traffic. He was seen at Southwest Texas Medical Center and then sent here appearing somewhat anxious, with a normal physical examination, normal EKG, normal chest x-ray, and normal metabolic panel. Most likely low probability for ischemia. Risk factors are also very low.

As you know, he is a 53-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02\/11\/60 for presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring. His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain. He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds. The test was terminated for 7\/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted, so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant. Since the implant Mr. Hess describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have vanished, however, he has noticed that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations, which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker.\nInterrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa QQ 626 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction. His estimated battery longevity is 89 months. The atrial impedance is 569 ohms, the ventricular impedance is 529 ohms. The P-wave is 5.6 mV. The R-wave is 31.3 mV. The threshold in the atrium is 0.75 V at 0.4 mV, and the threshold in the ventricle is 0.75 V at 0.4 msec.\nIn summary, Mr. Hess is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement. His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed. There is no sign of erythema or hematoma. However, his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing. Looking at his heart rate histogram, it appears that this sinus rates have varied from 80-120 beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal. I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia. For this reason, I have performed a TSH today, which is normal, however, I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated. I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time. I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time, and if any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.\nSincerely,\n\n\nUna Trujillo, MD\nDictated By: Una Trujillo\neScription document:9-1748355 UFFocus\nCC: Robert Yousif Gordon MD 803 FAIRHAVEN ROAD OLNEY, OH 23751\nDD: 02\/27\/60 DT: 02\/27\/60 DV: 02\/26\/60\n\n* Record date: 2060-05-21\n\n\n\nHESS, CLARENCE\n64365595\n05\/21\/2060\n\n\nRobert Y. Gordon, M.D.\nWMNH Internal Medicine Olney\n494 Fairhaven Road\nOlney, OH 23751\n\nDear Dr. Gordon:\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today. As you know, he is a 54-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02\/11\/2060 for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.\n\nHis past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain. He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds. The test was terminated for 7\/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted. We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr. Hess has done well since that time. He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved. However, he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort. He tells me that he underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality, though the report of this test is not available to me today for review.\n\nInterrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE 226 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction. The estimated longevity on the battery life is 95 months. The atrial impedance is 544 ohms and the ventricular impedance is 519 ohms. The P-wave in the atrium is 5.6 mV and the R-wave in the ventricle is 31 mV. The threshold in the atrium is stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec, and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec.\n\nIn summary, the pacemaker appears to be working quite well. However, Mr. Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation. I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia. In addition, I have performed a 12-lead ECG, which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia. Today in the office, his sinus rate is 109 beats per minute with stable blood pressure. Mr. Hess and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable.\n\nI have discussed this case with Dr. Quatrell Swanson who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr. Hess in the near future, since Dr. Law is moving his practice to the NCHC. I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time for his pacemaker. If any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nUna Trujillo, MD\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:4-3989721 UFFocus transcriptionists\n\n\n\nDD: 06\/02\/60\nDT: 06\/02\/60\nDV: 05\/21\/60\n\n* Record date: 2060-08-05\n5 August 2060\n\n\nQuatrell Swanson, MD\nDivision of Cardiology\nBarney Convalescent Hospital\n\nRe: Clarence H. HESS\nBCH 643-65-59-5\n\nDear Dr. Swanson:\n\nI had the pleasure of caring for Clarence Hess at BCH 08\/04-03\/07. He is a 54-year-old man with obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, S\/P dual-chamber pacemaker placement by Dr. Una Trujillo in February, 2060. He complained of fatigue and exertional throat tightness and a nuclear stress test in June, 2060, revealed apical ischemia and an ejection fraction of 70 percent. Cardiac catheterization performed by Dr. Leslie Campbell on 08\/04\/60 via the right radial artery revealed a right dominant system, a tight lesion in the proximal LAD, and no other focally occlusive disease. He received a 3mm stent, postdilated to 3.5mm, with an excellent angiographic result.\n\nHe spent an uneventful night without complaints, ambulating and voiding without difficulty. His right wrist was stable, and his hand warm and well perfused. Morning labs included a BUN of 16, creatinine 0.9, negative cardiac enzymes, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 238,000, cholesterol 182, HDL 37, LDL 91 and triglycerides 269. He was discharged home on aspirin, 325mg po qd; Plavix, 75mg po qd, to be continued for at least six months according to the research trial protocol; atenolol, 50mg po qd; Lipitor, 80mg po qd; Prilosec, 20mg po qd; Proventil, two puffs qid; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain. We've asked him to see you in the next couple of weeks, and to call if he has questions before then. He also will follow up with the research staff per protocol guidelines. Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care. Please don't hesitate to call with questions.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nBrittany Witt, MD\nBW\/brown\ncc: Robert Y.

Unfortunately, we did not connect back in December following the receipt of his lipid data that included a marked and unacceptable LDL elevation. We had left a message with his daughter, Lea. Additional laboratory data at that time included a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2%.\nHe is seeking to establish a new relationship with a primary care physician through Barney Convalescent Hospital. He has also had problems of at least 2 years duration with erectile dysfunction and decreased libido.\nMEDICATIONS: His medications are atenolol 50 mg b.i.d, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, ezetimibe 10 mg daily, Ecotrin 325 mg daily, Prilosec 20 mg daily. He apparently ran out of his clopidogrel some time ago and did not renew the prescription. It was his understanding that he was to remain on this medication for only six months following the PCI procedure.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His heart rate at rest is 105. His initial blood pressure 149\/96, but then 150\/82 on repeat, using a large cuff. His weight is down 4 pounds to 193. His venous pressure and carotid upstrokes are normal. His lung fields are clear. He has no cardiac murmur. There are no pulse deficits or peripheral edema.\nHis ECG shows a sinus tachycardia (after rushing into the office) and an incomplete right bundle-branch block pattern with a normal QRS duration. In comparison with his tracing from 12\/24\/2060, his resting heart rate has increased.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: He will keep a diary of blood pressure and heart rate recordings over the next month on the basis of which we will determine next steps. It is possible that the higher dose beta-blocker contributes to his erectile dysfunction, though the problem may have antedated this medication altogether. We will refer him to the practice of Dr. Ohara and Dr. Xiao, as well as to Dr. Sutherland, the latter specifically to help us evaluate his longstanding erectile dysfunction.\nHe will continue his efforts at weight loss. He is working out at the gym 2-3 times per week.\nQuatrell Swanson, M.D.\n\n\neScription document:5-9051404 AFFocus\n\nDD: 07\/08\/60 DT: 07\/09\/60 DV: 07\/08\/60\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2080-07-28\n\n\nJuly 28, 2080\n\n\n\nDr. Keys\n\n\n\nRE:Fair, Bill\nMR#:220-41-86-4\n\nDear Dr. Keys:\n\nDr. Oates and I saw Bill Fair today with regard to his troublesome\nright knee. As you are aware he is a 56 year old man who is a convenience store manager. He has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years,\nmainly related to sports injuries.\n\nHe has had in particular 2 years of pain now in his right knee. It got so\nbad 6 months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that.\n\nIt has slowly got better since then.\n\nAt present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with\nactivity but he also has rest and night pain. He has a restricted walking\ndistance.\n\nWith regard to function, he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and\nrequires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work. He has\nnoticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed.\n\nWith regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of\nTylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to\nhave a colonoscopy in the near future.\n\nHe has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet.\n\nOn examination I note he has bilateral varus knees, worse on the right than\nthe left. He has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust.\n\nHe has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of\narthritis. He has a 5 degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to 115\ndegrees. His varus deformity is not fully correctable. He has grade 5\nquadriceps power.\n\nX-rays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete\nobliteration of joint space on the right side.\n\nI note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment\narthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic.\n\nWe have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial\nosteotomy, a unicompartmental knee replacement, and a total knee replacement.\n\nAt present neither he not Dr. Oates feels that his symptoms are severe\nenough to warrant operative intervention. We would certainly reconsider\nshould he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee,\ninstilling some corticosteroids. We have advised him that this will only\nprovide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin\nsome walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight.\n\nWe have organized to see him again in 4-6 month's time at which stage we will\nreassess him. Should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly\nring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the\nknee and instill some corticosteroid.\n\nWith kind regards.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\nOliver M.

He has known complication of retinopathy and is status post bilateral laser surgery about one year ago. He has no known neuropathy or nephropathy. He has no known history of CAD, CVA or PVD. He had previously been followed by Dr. Elizabeth Keys at Pioneer Hospital at Findlay until June of this year which time he switched to a new primary care doctor. At that time, he had been on glyburide, metformin and Avandia, his new PCP increased his glyburide and his Avandia. He also stopped his hydrochlorothiazide out of concern that this is not an ideal agent for a diabetic patient. Over the next weeks to months, the patient had progressive peripheral edema, fluid weight gain and ultimately development of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He returned for care and was started on furosemide and has been recently titrated up to a dose of 60 mg orally on this. He self adjusted his Avandia dose from 4 mg twice daily to 2 mg daily. His prebreakfast blood glucose has been elevated ranging from 160-200. He has had some resolution of his fluid overload with the Lasix and lower dose Avandia. He says he has persistent feeling of swelling and tightness in his fingers and toes with episodic ankle swelling as well. He denies chest pain, claudication polyuria, polydipsia. He has been losing weight since starting Lasix. He has never had hypoglycemia.\n\nDIABETES SURVELLIANCE AND MANAGEMENT:\nHemoglobin A1c 11.4% (10\/01\/84).\nCholesterol 190, LDL cholesterol 190, HDL 49 (10\/01\/84) and LDL 118 (07\/02\/84).\nMicroalbumin to creatinine 19 (07\/02\/84).\nCreatinine 0.9 (07\/02\/84).\nLast eye exam 09\/83.\nPneumovax never.\nInfluenza vaccine never.\nAspirin 325 mg daily.\nACE inhibitor yes (lisinopril 10 mg daily,).\nStatin yes (Lipitor 40 mg daily).\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nDiabetes as above.\nDiabetic retinopathy.\nHypertension.\nOsteoarthritis of the knees.\nStatus post hammertoe repair.\nPilonidal cyst status post I&D.\nSevered Achilles tendon status post repair.\nRight meniscus removal.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Glyburide 10 mg twice daily, metformin 1000 mg twice daily and the Avandia 2 mg daily, Lipitor 40 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily. furosemide 60 mg daily, multivitamin one tablet daily and Viagra as needed.\n\nALLERGIES: Amoxicillin gives him a rash.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He works as a manager in a convenience store, he lives with his wife. He has no kids. He does not exercise secondary to joint pain. He tends to eat a lot of carbohydrates and meats although he does not have a sweet tooth. He denies tobacco, alcohol or recreational drug use.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI, otherwise, negative.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His weight is 270 pounds, his blood pressure is 150\/92 and then 155\/92 to my a repeat exam, pulse is 70 and regular. In general, he is a well-appearing gentleman in no acute distress. His skin is warm and dry. Extraocular movements are intact. Oropharynx is clear. Mucous membranes are moist. He has no carotid bruits. His thyroid is normal in size and contour. Lung exam reveals crackles at the bases. His heart is regular in rate and rhythm with an S1, S2, without S3 or S4. Abdomen is obese, soft and nontender. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. His extremities are without clubbing or cyanosis. There is 2+ pitting edema to the ankles. His foot exam reveals that his distal pulses are okay. Sensation is intact to monofilament. There is no skin breakdown or ulcerations. He has an extensive onychomycosis of the nails bilaterally.\n\nGlucose 132.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 61-year-old gentleman with type II diabetes complicated by retinopathy and erectile dysfunction. He has had inadequate glycemic control on oral agents which are currently at their maximal doses given the intolerable side effects of Avandia. He has plans for elective knee replacement during the spring and we have advised him that before he consider that he should get his diabetes under better control, should make sure his blood pressure is controlled and should seek cardiac evaluation, especially given his history of pulmonary edema symptoms on Avandia.\n\n1. We will start insulin today initially NPH 25 units at bedtime to replace his evening dose of glyburide. We have instructed him on use of the Inolet for insulin administration. He will continue his glyburide 10 mg each morning, continue metformin 1000 mg twice daily and Avandia 2 mg each morning. We will check hemoglobin A1c today as a baseline. We will follow up to determine appropriate titration of his insulin as well as addition of other doses during the day.\n2. His blood pressure is not optimally controlled at this time. We will increase his lisinopril to 40 mg daily. He will continue his furosemide 60 mg daily and he will continue to titrate his Lasix dosing at the guidance of his primary care doctor.\n3. His last microalbumin to creatinine ratio and creatinine were normal. Testing is up-to-date.\n4. The patient has an LDL that was above target this summer and Lipitor was initiated; however, he has not been on this long enough to see an effect. At his next visit, we will reevaluate his lipids to determine if his Lipitor needs titration.\n5. He is overdue for an eye exam and will contact Dr. Xuereb at Findlay him to have this done.\n6. We have made a referral to Dr. Liam Mcmahon for cardiology evaluation. We have ordered an echocardiogram to be performed prior to this visit. We have also referred the patient to a number of possible PCPs in the OMC\/CBC system.\n\nThe patient was advised to return to the office in two months for follow up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorence Mildred Yuan, MD\n\n\nDictated By: Florence Mildred Yuan\n\n\neScription document:2-8940866 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 12\/16\/84\nDT: 12\/16\/84\nDV: 12\/12\/84\n\n* Record date: 2085-02-18\nKH Cardiovascular Division CVD RM5 75 Weymouth Dr FAIR, BILL Plymouth, IN 46368 22041864 (958) 688-5162 02\/18\/85\nFlorence Mildred Yuan, M.D. Endocrinology\/Osteopathic Medical Center 02 Weymouth Dr Plymouth, IN 46368\nDear Dr. Yuan:\nI saw your patient, Bill Fair, in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March 23, 2085, and thank you for having him come here for evaluation. I will be sending a copy of this letter to Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.\nMr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations. He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years. About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group. His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94. His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d, and metformin 1000 mg q.d. He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d.\nHis other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past. He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure. He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor. He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese.\nHe has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath.\nHis other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia. His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.\nHe had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH. Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%. The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar. The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar. The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.\nHis past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so. He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago. He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees. Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently. He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085.\nSocial history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use. He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.\nHis review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.\nOn exam, he is obese but comfortable. Blood pressure is 150\/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds. Head and neck are unremarkable. Chest is clear. Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees. PMI is normal. S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split. There is an S4 and 1\/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border. Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly. The abdomen is obese. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis. Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit. Distal pulses are normal.\nHis resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3. He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI. The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.\nMr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction. This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information. We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion. In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible. He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so. I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone. We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available. I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results. If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me. We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week. Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.\nKindest personal regards.\n\n\nLiam Mcmahon, MD\nDictated By: Liam Mcmahon\neScription document:6-8059879 SFFocus\nCC: Oliver Oates M.D. Osteopathic Medical Center 73 Weymouth Dr Plymouth, IN 46368\nDD: 02\/18\/85 DT: 02\/18\/85 DV: 02\/18\/85\n\n* Record date: 2085-03-21\n\n\n\n\n\n21 March 2085\n\n\nLiam K.

He is a 61-year-old man with CAD, DM, high cholesterol, HTN, and family history of early CAD, who had a stress test that showed peri-infarct ischemia in the left circumflex and PDA. Angiography showed a codominant system, a 100 percent left circumflex occlusion, an 85 percent RC lesion, and nonobstructive LAD lesions. The left circumflex was recanalized and a Taxus 2.5mm by 32mm stent was placed. The procedure was done with Angiomax and the sheath was pulled manually. There were no complications.\n\nHe spent an uneventful evening without complaints or complications, ambulating without difficulty. His groin was soft and tender with ecchymosis but no hematoma. Extremities were warm with 1+ edema to the ankles; pulses were 2+ throughout. Morning labs included cholesterol of 114, triglycerides 109, HDL 34 and LDL 58. He was discharged home on NPH insulin; Mucomyst, 600mg bid; aspirin, 325mg qd; atenolol, 25mg qd; Lasix, 60mg qd; glyburide, 10mg qd; lisinopril, 40mg qd; Lipitor, 40mg qd; Diovan, 80mg qd; Plavix, 75mg qd; metformin, 500mg bid to be restarted on 03\/23\/85; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.

In terms of her cardiac history, she was well\nuntil four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath\nand was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart\nfailure. At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which\nrevealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to\nshortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a\ndilated left ventricle. In addition, she had an echo in June of\n2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral\nregurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction.\nShe has never been hospitalized since that time for her\ncongestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good\nresult. She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or\nclaudication. She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.\nIn fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her\nrecollection. She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house\nand can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs. She is\nable to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty\nfrom chest\n\nJorgenson, Vivian Lea\nMR #471-90-84-7 -2- August 21, 2071\n\npains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops\nsecondary to fatigue.\n\nHer past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,\nCHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule. She has never had\nsurgery. Her family history is significant for a mother who died\nof myocardial infarction at the age of 55.\n\nHer social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for\n40 years and quit four years ago. She denies alcohol, intravenous\ndrugs or cocaine use. She lives with her husband and briefly\nworked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer. She\nhas no known drug allergies.\n\nHer current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril\n50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po\nQD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily\nand Gemfibrozil 600mg BID.\n\nOn physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170\/85 in\nher left arm and 165\/70 in her right. Her heart rate was 104 when\nI saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today. Her JVP was 7\ncentimeters. Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid\nbruits. Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles. Her\nheart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with\noccasional ectopic beats. She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2\/6\nsystolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without\nradiation. Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds. Her\nextremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.\n\nHer EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80. She has a\ndiffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin\neffects. She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old\nanterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.\n\nIn summary, Ms. Jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,\nhyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease\nwith congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,\nlikely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial\ninfarction, although she has never undergone heart\ncatheterization. She is currently undergoing evaluation for a\nthyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule.\n\nJorgenson, Vivian Lea\nMR #471-90-84-7 -3- August 21, 2071\n\nIssue number one, preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment:\ngiven that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden\nsince 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with\nimaging. If this is similar to her previous study showing only\nfixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she\nwill be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative\nmyocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is\nwell treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having\nsurgery.\n\nIssue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection\nfraction. She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection\nfraction. As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation\nand she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or\nrhythm. Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days\nprior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after\nsurgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons\nas to how may days she should wait after surgery before\nrestarting that medication. She will otherwise remain on her\ncurrent medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and\nprimary care physician, Dr. Charles Van. If her stress test\nis without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for\nfurther evaluation.\n\nThank you for referring this interesting patient. She was seen\nand examined with Dr. Voss.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nPamela Imperial, M.D.\nPI\/waldron\n\ncc:\nCharles Van, M.D.\n\nJordan, FL 83712\n\n\n\n\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2071-11-24\n\n\nThyroid Division\nJeanes Memorial Hospital\n89 Buck St\nSioux City, FL 76546\n\n\nVivianLee Jorgenson\nMR# 471-90-84-7\nNovember 24, 2071\n\nThis is the first visit for Ms. Jorgenson who is a 64 year old woman who presents\nfor management of papillary thyroid cancer. Her symptoms began in May, 2071,\nwhen she felt a prominence in her neck. She did not experience any dysphagia\nor voice changes, but presumably was felt to have an abnormality on thyroid\nexamination. She underwent a thyroid biopsy in June, 2071, at a local\nhospital. The pathology which was read at JMH revealed numerous follicular\ncells with chromatin grooves suspicious for papillary carcinoma. She was\nsubsequently referred to Dr. Geiger at JMH for thyroidectomy and underwent\nthyroidectomy on 9\/17\/71. The thyroidectomy was uncomplicated though there\nwas inadvertent displacement of a parathyroid gland and this gland was then\nreimplanted. According to the operative report, the carcinoma was felt to be\nlocally extensive though no laryngo-tracheal nerve invasion was present. The\npathology revealed a (R) 6 cm papillary carcinoma with capsular and\nlymphovascular invasion. There was an additional focus of papillary\ncarcinoma, follicular variant, in the (L) thyroid lobe that was 0.3 cm. Of\nnote, the tissue was stained for calcitonin and this was negative. The tumor\ndid stain positively for thyroglobulin.\n\nSince undergoing thyroidectomy, Ms. Jorgenson has done fairly well. She has been\nmaintained on 75 mcg daily of Levoxyl. She says that she feels generally\nwell on this dose though she does endorse slight fatigue. She denies any\nchanges in her sleep, hair, skin or bowels. She does endorse a one pound\nweight gain over the last two months. She denies any paresthesias or other\nsymptoms consistent with hypocalcemia. She denies any history of thyroid\ndisturbances prior to her diagnosis of cancer. She is now referred for\nconsideration of radioiodine ablation.\n\nPast Medical History:Notable for congestive heart failure. She has an\nejection fraction of 25%. She also has a history of hypercholesterolemia,\nhypertension, and anxiety. No history of childhood irradiation.\n\nCurrent Medications:Digoxin 0.25 daily; Coreg 12.5 mg daily; Levoxyl 75\nmcg daily; Lipitor 10 mg daily; Coumadin 5 mg daily; Lasix 40 mg daily;\ncaptopril 50 mg, tid; labetolol 100, bid; nitroglycerine.\n\nAllergies:No known drug allergies.\n\nSocial History:Remote history of tobacco. She quit 4 years ago. She\nendorses rare alcohol use. She is married with four children.\n\nFamily History:Negative for thyroid cancer.\n\nPhysical Exam:Blood pressure is elevated at 188\/92. Weight 208. Pulse\n88. In general this is a somewhat tired, slightly pale-appearing woman in\nNAD. HEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. No proptosis or lid lag.

Lungs: clear to\nauscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular: normal S1, S2, regular rate and\nrhythm. Abdomen: soft, slightly distended, non-tender, moderately obese.\nExtremities: trace pedal edema, 1+ distal pulses. Neurologic: reflexes are\nslightly delayed. There is no tremor of outstretched hands.\n\nReview of Labs:Of note, include a TSH of 1.65 from August, 2071, that was\nprior to surgery. Free T4 at that time was normal at 1.1. Calcium prior to\nsurgery was slightly elevated at 10.6 though several calciums drawn after her\nsurgery were in the mid-8 range.\n\nImpression:This is a 64 year old woman with a history of congestive heart\nfailure who is now s\/p total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer. Ms.\nJorgenson is potentially at higher risk for recurrence given the fact that she is\nolder at the time of diagnosis, she had a large-size tumor, and she had\nmultifocal disease.\n\nPlan:Check a TSH and thyroglobulin today for a baseline. We suspect that\nshe may be undertreated on her current dose of Levoxyl. I have recommended\n131I treatment. Benefits and risks were discussed. In addition, I think she\nwould tolerate thyroid hormone withdrawal. TSH and calcium were drawn today.\n\nWe will plan to arrange for 131I for January.\n\n\n\n\nHilda Vincent, M.D.\n\n\n\nBrittany Farrar, M.D.\n\n\n\nBF\/cooley\ncc:Aiden Geiger, M.D.\n\n\n\nHilda Vincent\n\nDD: 11\/24\/71\nDT: 12\/31\/71\nDV: 11\/24\/71\n\n\n\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2074-06-20\nHHH Cardiovascular Division CVD Rm 5 89 Buck St JORGENSON, VIVIANLEE Sioux City, FL 76546 47190847 (179) 732-8159 06\/20\/74\nCharles F. Van, M.D. 66 Kessler Farm Drive, Puite #9488 Jordan, FL 83712\nDear Dr. Van:\nI had the pleasure of participating in the care of VivianLee Jorgenson during her recent hospitalization at Goulds Hospital. This lovely 67-year-old female ended up having no discernable coronary artery disease on catheterization. At the time of the cath, her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 12. During the course of her hospitalization, we noted as well that she had had runs of nonsustained VT and asked our EP colleagues to comment on the appropriateness of an ICD. They felt that this could certainly be rediscussed in the future, but at the present time, there was no compelling indication for her to receive an ICD.\nHer medications at discharge include Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d, digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d, captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d, Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d, enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d, Nexium 20 mg p.o. q.d, Synthroid 300 mcg p.o. q.d, Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d, Coreg 25 mg p.o. b.i.d, and Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d.\nIt has been a delight to participate in the care of this lovely woman.

She presents with\nepisodes of gait instability, diffuse weakness, multiple falls.\nShe was brought in by her family for further evaluation. She\nalso had dark stools over the past few weeks. She denies any\nassociated chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, any\nsyncope, any nausea or vomiting. She does have a bruise on her\nchin. She denies any focal weakness, numbness, or tingling. No\nhematuria, no epistaxis or gum bleeding.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure, atrial\nfibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease,\nhypercholesterolemia, and thyroid disease.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with family.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As noted in the written chart and the HPI,\notherwise negative.\nMEDICATIONS: Include ranitidine, baby aspirin, Coumadin, Lasix,\nand digoxin.\nALLERGIES: None.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.5, pulse 60, respiratory\nrate 20, blood pressure 136\/60, and oxygen 95% on room air.\nGeneral: This is a pleasant female, elderly; she has got a 3-cm\necchymosis over her mid left chin as well as over her left\nshoulder. Her pupils are reactive. Neck is supple.\nRespiratory: Clear to auscultation. Cardiovascular: Regular\nrate. Abdomen is soft. Rectal is heme-positive, heme-positive\nmelena per the resident. Skin is otherwise with bruises over the\nleft arm as well as a bruise over the right thumb that appears\nhealing. Extremities are with good range of motion. No focal\ntenderness. She is oriented x3. Mood and affect are normal.\nShe is moving all extremities equally.\nLABORATORY DATA: Chest x-ray shows no acute cardiomediastinal\nprocess and head CT preliminary shows no intracranial\nabnormalities. Laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit\nof 16, creatinine of 1.5, BUN of 95, troponin less than 0.04, and\nplatelets of 358. INR of 2. Urinalysis with 2+ ketones, no\nblood.\nINITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN: This 71-year-old female presents\nwith generalized weakness and gait instability and frequent\nfalls, concerning for either an evolving intracranial process\nsuch as a subdural or stroke. This has been going on for several\nweeks, however, but also presents with melena over the past\nseveral weeks and profound anemia for which she required\ntransfusion in the Emergency Department. We did order a CT of\nthe brain to evaluate for intracranial injury or abnormality both\ngiven the frequent falls and as the cause of the falls. This\ndoes not show any large subdural or mass lesion. She is quite\nanemic has melanotic heme-positive stool. I suspect this is the\netiology, but it seems like it has been a slow progression, and\nconcerned given her cardiac history also the weakness and could\nrepresent coronary insufficiency. She does not have an elevated\ntroponin at present. She will need to be further monitored. She\nwas transfused here in the Emergency Department given her\nprofoundly low hematocrit after consent was obtained.\nClinically, feels better. I discussed with the patient's family\nbecause of the bleeding he will need to be evaluated as\nfurther cardiac biomarkers and further monitoring as well as\nphysical therapy evaluation once the patient's acute medical\nissues have been addressed. She will be admitted to the medical\nservice with diagnosis of symptomatic anemia, gastrointestinal\nbleeding, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation in\nstable condition.\n\nXUEREB, VESTER M.D.\nD: 05\/29\/78\nT: 05\/30\/78\nDictated By: XUEREB, VESTER\neScription document:9-7189367 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2084-04-12\nRACHAEL G.

Referring Diagnosis: Status post cardiac transplant. Rule out osteoporosis. HPI: Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, diagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement. At the time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative. Whether this was a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgki's lymphoma is unclear to us, but he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for approximately 26 weeks. At that point, he was believed to be in remission and stayed in remission since then. In 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he presented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision. Subsequently he was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since that time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and six of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper. He currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the 100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus Paz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this. The patient's complications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent. There is no peripheral neuropathy. There is no autonomic neuropathy. No retinal disease. However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline creatinine currently of 2.4. Recently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial symptoms in the early 80s. By June of 2082, the patient had fairly severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July 2082 to June of 2083, the patient apparently had 5 myocardial infarctions. In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac transplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick. Since that time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection with relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum degree of symptoms. The patient's current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a day; prednisone 8 mg. a day. Azathioprine 250 mg. a day; Axid 150 mg. twice a day; Cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; Cardura 4 mg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs. Review of Systems: Has had one fracture of his right ring finger that was from a trauma some years ago. Other past medical history includes history of sleep apnea and depression and the things mentioned. RACHAEL G.

Cardiac exam otherwise unremarkable. His abdomen was soft. He had some evidence of insulin injections, but no significant hypertrophy. He injects both in his abdomen and rotates with his arms. His extremities revealed minimal stasis dermatitis, normal pulses, and were symmetric. No edema. Neurologically he was diffusely hyporeflexic. He had normal to slightly decreased vibratory sensation in his big toes. Laboratory Exam: Most recent laboratories that I could find were February 09, 2084. Sodium 141. K 5.1; chloride 105. Bicarb 20. BUN 39. Creatinine 3.4; glucose 136. His CK was 219. Calcium 9.7. Albumin 4.3; phosphate 4.0. Alkaline phosphatase was 90. Uric acid 5.1; magnesium 1.9. TSH was 1.6. Cholesterol 242. Triglycerides 226. His cyclosporine level was in the therapeutic range at 273. His CBC revealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a normal differential.

OBRYAN, M.D. VALLEJO GENERAL HOSPITAL ENDOCRINOLOGY DIVISION Workman, Edwin 007 Lunar Lane 61248040 Brookshire, MO 15345 4-12-84 Page 3 the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of osteoporosis. The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant. The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant patients. However, getting a bone density study in the patient like this makes sense. We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling reasons. We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to do for him is to give him vitamin D. His calcium intake was estimated to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day. We would be a little reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, without more information about this patient. The patient's diabetes seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we don't have access to hemoglobin A1C. Given the fact that it sounds like he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone situation. Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to RACHAEL G.

Paz, M.D. 5 Fox Meadow Road Hebron, WI 31155 RE: Edwin Workman MR #612-48-04-0 Dear Dr. Paz: I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Workman in follow-up today. Overall, he is doing very well from a cardiovascular perspective. Unfortunately, he continues to gain weight but overall he is doing well. His current medical regimen includes cyclosporin 150 b.i.d, prednisone 6 mg q.d, Imuran 275 q.d, Cardizem CD 300 mg q.d, Cardura 4 mg q.d, one baby aspirin a day, Axid 150 b.i.d, pravachol 20 q.d, magnesium oxide 250 mg b.i.d, calcium and vitamin D, insulin NPH 54 units and 10 Regular in the morning, 32 units of NPH and 8 of Regular in the evening. On physical examination, he was obese. Blood pressure of 150\/90 with a heart rate of 85, weight was 305 pounds which is increased 5 pounds from September 21st. Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion. Cardiac exam reveals a flat JVP at 30 degrees, a non- displaced PMI with a normal S1, S2 without murmurs, rubs or gallops. Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits. His abdomen is obese, soft and nontender. It is difficult to appreciate any organomegaly. There is no hepatojugular reflux. Extremities are without edema. Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 85. Intervals of .16\/.08\/.34 with an axis of 60 degrees. This is a normal tracing unchanged from previous tracing. Therefore, Mr. Workman is doing well from a cardiovascular perspective. We will make the necessary adjustments in his medical regimen according to his laboratory results. Unfortunately, he did take his cyclosporin this morning and therefore he will mail his labs back to us. I did discuss with him attempting some weight loss with portion control. I think it might work to give him some reasonable goals such as a weight loss of 30 pounds as apposed to 130. Workman, Edwin MR #612-48-04-0 -2- October 17, 2085 Mr. Workman will return in January for a biopsy and clinic visit. Best regards.

Overall he is relatively stable from a cardiac standpoint. Most importantly, recently he was laid off from his job at Belkin. He has been quite depressed about this. His medical regimen includes Cyclosporin 150 b.i.d, prednisone 6 q.d, Imuran 275 q.d, Cardizem CD 300 q.d, Cardura 4 mg. q.d, Pravachol 40 mg. q.d, Axid 150 b.i.d, Calcium, vitamin C and D, Mag. Oxide 250 q.d, Paxil 300 q.d, NPH Insulin. On physical examination he was well appearing in no distress. He had a blood pressure of 136\/80 with a heart rate of 90, weight was 309 pounds which has increased eight pounds from July. Chest was clear to auscultation. Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP at 30 degrees, non-displaced PMI with a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs or gallops. Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits. Abdomen was soft, nontender. There is no organomegaly, no hepatojugular reflux. Extremities without edema. Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 90. Intervals of .16\/.08\/.33 with an axis of 70 degrees.

She says the pain migrated to involve all of the joints in her hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders and knees. She noticed swelling in her R knee, no swelling or redness in other joints. Her muscles are diffusely tender. She recalls similar muscle discomfort in prior episodes attributed to fibromyalgia, although not as severe.

She denies any morning stiffness, any jelling phenomena. She has had no trauma or effusions in the knee. She had noted on x-ray many years ago that she had had a chipped bone in the right knee and some mild osteoarthritis but it has bothered her only intermittently until this year. Last year she did go to Briggs Stratton and dropped to 270 lb. at which point her knees felt better, but currently she is back up to over 300 lb. and at her height of 5 ft. 1 in, she is in pain. She has not visited a physician. She has no internist who currently checks on her general medical health, but she does report that the occasional Advil she takes does produce some dyspepsia. She has no history of gout, no history of psoriasis, no history of pseudogout or any rash, alopecia, headaches, shoulder or hip discomfort. She does not complain of back pain but does have difficult walking 50 yards because of the knee pain. Allergies: None. Medications: Occasional Advil. Past Surgical History: Cholecystectomy 2064. Two c-sections. Past Medical History: Negative for hypertension, diabetes, cancer, stroke, tuberculosis, hepatitis, asthma, heart disease. Family History: Mother is alive and well with no medical problems. Father is alive and well with no medical problems. She has 12 siblings. One sibling died of pneumonia at a young age.

Examination of joints: No evidence of active synovitis or pain in her DIPs, PIPs, MCPs, wrists, elbows, shoulders. Bilateral hips are limited in internal external rotation but not because of pain-- due to obesity, bilateral knees have crepitus, but no warmth or swelling. There is some pain at extremes of flexion on the left of 110 degrees. Ankles and toes within normal limits. Please note above in the clinical history that she does not complain of back pain but does have difficult walking 50 yards because of the knee pain. The blood pressure could not be taken secondary to the fact that the large blood pressure cuff did not fit around her right arm. Impression: 1. Probable bilateral osteoarthritis.

She has had multiple admissions in the past for CHF and for ischemia. Recent echo shows septal and apical hypokinesis.\n\nShe has had no chest pain. She does not complain of SOB. She does cough, but this is because of the air conditioning and postnasal drip, she believes.\n\nShe also complains of severe knee pain, with the right worse than the left. She can walk a little, but standing is very painful.\n\nIn addition, she complains of some food intolerance. She has a hard time eating breakfast because she gets abdominal cramps. After eating orange juice, she gets terrible cramping and has to run to the bathroom to have a bowel movement. She has changed her milk to lactaid, which she says helps. Certain types of salad dressing also cause this reaction.\n\nProblems\nMORBID OBESITY\nKNEE OA\nANSERINE BURSITIS, BILAT\nS\/P 2 C-SECTIONS\nHTN\nCAD\nCHF\nASTHMA\n\nMedications\nVENTOLIN 2PUFFS INH QID\nAZMACORT 4PUFFS INH BID\nECASA 1 PO QD\nATROVENT 2PUFFS INH QID\nTNG 0.4 MG SL\nSEREVENT 2PUFFS INH BID\nFLOVENT 220MCG INH BID\nCOZAAR 100MG PO QD\nLOPRESSOR 25MG PO TID\nLASIX 60MG PO BID\nZANTAC 150MG PO BID\nNORVASC 10MG PO QD\nISOSORBIDE DINITRATE 20MG 1 Tablet(s) PO TID\n\nAllergies\nLISINOPRIL COUGH\n\nSocial History\nEmployment: Works in commercial diving.\nMarital\/Relationship: She is married.

He is a 71-year-old, right-handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 29, 2088 with left arm weakness, ataxia and dysarthria. The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke. An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata. The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission, despite being heparinized. The following day, he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side. Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally. There was no critical carotid stenosis. He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction, dilated left atrium, very mild inferior hypokinesis, and no patent foramen ovale. He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias. His cholesterol level was 152 with an HDL of 23. It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery, involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries. He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis. He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen.\nSince his discharge from the hospital, he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months. He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia. He has no symptoms of aphasia. He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event, which he feels has improved. I would agree with him. He also has regained some strength in the left leg, and is currently working on using a walker with assistance. Unfortunately, he has not regained any use of the left arm. He has not had any problems with spasms.\nHis past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2060. He had a quadruple bypass in 2083. His last stress test in 2087 showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct. He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis. He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes. He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy. His medications currently include clonidine .1 mg. p.o. b.i.d, Plavix 75 mg. p.o. q.d, aspirin 325 mg. p.o. q.d, Neurontin 300 mg. p.o. q.h.s, Gemfibrozil 600 mg. p.o. b.i.d, Isordil and Lasix. He had been on Captopril earlier, but he has since been taken off that medicine. He was managed with insulin during his prior admission. I assume he is still on this medicine, although he did not specifically state so. He has an allergy to sulfa drugs. The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery. The patient quit smoking 15 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions. There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers, but no family history of stroke. On examination, he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress. His blood pressure was 150\/90. His language was intact. His speech was somewhat dysarthric, although this was improved from his admission. He was alert and oriented. His conversation was appropriate. The visual fields were full. The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm. Facial sensation was normal. There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop. The tongue and palate were midline. The patient had 0\/5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm. There was atrophy of the left biceps. There was full range of motion of the joints. The patient had 2\/5 left iliopsoas, 4+\/5 hip extensors, 3\/5 left quadriceps, 3\/5 left ankle dorsiflexors, and 3\/5 ankle plantar flexors. The tone in the lower extremities was not increased. His right side was 5\/5. He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe. His right toe was downgoing. Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick. I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy. Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes. He was in a wheelchair, and his gait was not assessed. Mr. Parrish's recovery is progressing. He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker. I hope that this will be the case. Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement. I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness. His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries. I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled, as has been done, and to continue an anticholesterol agent. I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while. The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol. I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way. However, since he has been on this medicine so long, it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well. He should continue on an aspirin a day. He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost. I recommended to him that, in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care, patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type. We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this. This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal. After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin. I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months. I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year's time. The patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service, who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination.

EMON DUBOIS, M.D. ED65 * Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n* Record date: 2076-03-20\nOFFICE NOTE Lydia Levine MR #813-25-60-5 March 20, 2076 Ms. Levine is a 50-year-old, perimenopausal woman with non- insulin dependent diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and a history of tobacco use, who underwent a recent cardiac catheterization for a positive stress test. At catheterization she had a proximal 60% lesion in her RCA as well as a mid 60-70% RCA lesion, obtuse marginal lesion of 60%, and an LAD mid lesion of 60%. At the time it was decided to continue medical therapy on Ms. Levine. Since her cardiac catheterization approximately two weeks ago, she has had no recurrent symptoms of chest pain. She continues on her medicines including Lopid 500 mg b.i.d, atenolol, aspirin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, as well as her oral hypoglycemic medicines. Physical Examination: She is an obese, white female in no acute distress. Her vital signs are stable. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs or gallops. She has no peripheral edema. Electrocardiogram shows a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70, axis of about 46, and there are no acute ST-T changes noted. Impression\/Plan: We will continue Ms. Levine on her current cardiac regimen. She has three-vessel coronary artery disease, non-obstructive in nature. As long as she remains asymptomatic on her current medical regimen, we will continue to follow her. She will return for a follow-up visit in approximately three months.

His note reflects our joint assessment and plan.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, Ms. Levin is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who has known coronary artery disease. She had an exercise test in 2076 for some vague symptoms, which was positive, and led to cardiac catheterization. This catheterization revealed 60% LAD lesion, 50% first marginal, 60% RCA, and a 70% diagonal lesion. She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms. She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic. She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion. She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol. She achieved 93% of age-predicted maximal heart rate. At 4 minutes, she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort. She is a vague historian, but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, she is mildly obese white female. She has no jugular venous distention. Her carotids are 2+. Her heart shows normal S1 and S2. There is a 2\/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is benign. Extremities show no cyanosis or edema. Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and intervals. There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction.\nASSESSMENT: Ms. Levin is a 55-year-old diabetic woman with progressive anginal symptoms with known moderate 3-vessel coronary artery disease from 4 years ago with at least moderate risk, positive stress test. After discussion with Dr. Camacho, our plan will be continue her on aspirin, beta-blocker, and a low-dose ACE inhibitor through her regimen. She refuses to take a cholesterol-lowering agent due to previous concerns with myalgias. She will be referred for cardiac catheterization within the next several days with a goal to better define her coronary anatomy for the possibility of percutaneous coronary intervention versus cardiac bypass surgery.\n\n\nClyde Roe, MD\nDictated By: Clyde Roe\neScription document:1-3896405 AFFocus\n\nDD: 10\/11\/80 DT: 10\/12\/80 DV: 10\/11\/80\n\n* Record date: 2080-10-28\n\nVital Signs\nBP 122\/70, Temp 97.2 F, Wt 164 lb\n\nAGE 54y10.7m\n\n54 year old female presents to follow-up recent hospitalization for coronary angiogram. denies chest pain, SOB, but is experiencing pain at the site of the catheter insertion for her angiogram and stent placement. the pain is so strong that she cannot stand and walk for longer than a few minutes. there is no discoloration at the site, but the pain is a burning pain - as if someone poured alcohol on the spot. pain travels down the right leg\noccasionally feels discomfort in both calves when walking for a long distance\ntaking medications as directed but has not been able to get her insurance to pay for zetia.\ntaking lisinopril - no cough.

It diminishes only slightly as the day progresses. He denies any numbness, weakness, tingling, changes in vision or memory. He denies any recent URI. He does report tinnitus which has been present intermittently for years as well as bilateral sensorineural hearing secondary to gunshot exposure. No NV. The sensation of vertigo is superimposed upon one week of gradually progressive loss of balance, described as not knowing where to put his limbs in relation to space. He also reports ~7 days of mild diarrhea in a.m only, attributable to eating sorbitol ice cream as well as continuing to take Metamucil for the same 7 day period. Diarrhea has been fully resolved for 2 days PTA. He does report good PO fluid intake, ~8 bottles of H20 per day. He monitors his sugars regularly and reports they have been running in the 110-140s. He denies any fevers, chills, sweats or sick contacts. The patient does have ptosis on the L and reports that this has been present less than one month. He has had no changes in medications.\n\nAdditionally, the patient reports one episode of fleeting chest pain along the midaxillary line on 07\/12 which was relieved immediately by NTG. (Pt attributes the pain to gas as the belching coincident with the NTG also seemed to relieve the pain).

The first episode started this AM (10AM). It was left sided with out radiation non positional or pleuritic. Denies any associated sx such as palpitations, SOB, n,v. Although he has had a mild cough with throat irratation over the past few days. He was attributing this pain to gas but he took an aspirin and (expired) nitroglycerine SL just in case. He had an anteroseptal MI in 2092 and when questioned he does not feel this pain is similar to his prior attack. Later that day he had another episode of pain for which he felt more worried about, called the EMS for evaluation of a cardiac cause of his pain. On route to the Hospital the EMS gave SL nitro which relieved the pain. He was evaluated in the ED where he had EKG, cardiac enzymes and was given his normal dose of beta blocker. His EKG when compared showed evidence of his old anterior septal MI, possibly slightly inverted T waves in I,AVL and deeper T wave inversions in V1-3.\nFirst 2 sets of cardiac enzymes have been normal and he has remained CP free since the last nitro.\n\nROS: No F\/C\/NS.

She comes in with an acute headache this morning, followed by a syncopal event, which lasted approximately five seconds. Currently, she is complaining of intermittent chest pain and a continuing headache across her head and down to her eyes. PAST MEDICAL and SURGICAL HISTORY: The past history is notable for her CABG, as well as for a history of temporal arteritis. MEDICATIONS: She was on prednisone, which was recently stopped. The rest of the PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, and ALLERGIES: As documented in the written chart by the resident physician, and as reviewed by me. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, she is an elderly black female in no acute distress. She has a temperature of 100 degrees F, a pulse of 90, and a blood pressure of 150\/70. The O2 saturation is 97% on room air. The examination is notable for a surgically altered pupil in the right eye, which is non-reactive. The extraocular movements are intact. She has no palpable temporal or skull tenderness. The lungs show rhonchorous breath sounds throughout. The cardiovascular examination shows a midline scar, with a regular rate and rhythm and no murmur. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. The extremities show 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. The neurologic examination is grossly intact. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: This is an elderly female status post recent CABG, who had a syncopal episode this morning after complaining of a headache. The plan at this time is to obtain a head CT to rule out an intracerebral process. She has had an EKG, which does show some T-wave changes, different from when she was here for her CABG. She will also have cardiac enzymes sent and will be admitted to the hospital for further monitoring of her syncopal event. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): As above. The patient's condition on admission is stable.

Had been on Atenolol and Zestril but pt self-D\/C'd Zestril several wks ago because she thought the Zestril made her feel nauseated. Since then, has had gradually developing DOE from baseline of walking over 4-5 flights of stairs without difficulty to dyspnea on only a flight of stairs. She underwent L knee arthroscopy for medial meniscal tear on 11\/19\/78 without immediate complications. At 3 am that night, though, woke up with severe dyspnea, with some relief upon sitting up. Associated with some wheezing; tried some of husband's nebs only slight relief. Later over the day, dyspnea worsened to the point that only few steps would make short of breath. Some association with non-radiating substernal chest tightness in evening; no N\/V, lightheadness, diaphoresis, or pleuritic CP, F\/S\/C, or cough. Next day, dyspnea persisted so pt came into ED.\n\nIn ED, found to have BP of 230's\/120's, satting 70's on RA. CTA PE-protocol showing no PE or DVT but with pulm edema and bibasilar atelectasis vs. PNA (unlikely). Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 2.7 L diuresis; started on nitropaste, Captopril, Labetalol BP down to 140's. Also given ASA and Lopressor x 1 and started on Heparin IV. Given Levoflox x 1 for? PNA on CXR. Had to be on BiPAP for several hrs transitioned to 3L NC, satting mid-90's.

The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar 2-10 years ago appearance of symptoms.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nHypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\nBilateral eye surgeries, right shoulder surgeries, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgery as mentioned above.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\nMultiple antibiotics including isoniazid, doxycycline, insulin, Cardura, Glucophage, Elavil, and Biaxin. Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nOn today s examination, the patient was noted to have a fairly long carpal tunnel scar on bilateral hands extending all the way to the volar wrist level. Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted, the fourth trigger release, which was performed in 2062 as well. The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space. There is no locking or triggering, but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted. Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well. However, abductor pollicis brevis function is intact. Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand, but otherwise normal examination.\nIMPRESSION:\nAs above.\nPLAN:\nMy recommendation is that patient undergo very vigorous assessment for the median nerve function. In addition to this, I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers. It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study.\n\nVance-Ernest Yamasaki, M.D. Orthopaedics\nVEY\/kiser 59-56557099.doc\ncc: Harold Elliott, M.D.\n\n* Record date: 2073-04-27\nSDU Admission Note\nTuesday, Apr 27, 2073\n\nLujan, Victor\nSMH 0189233\n54yM\nSDU Admission: 04\/27\/73\n\nPCP: Elliott\nCards: Alston\n\nChief complaint\nChest pain\n\nHistory of present illness\n54 year old man with DM1 for >40 years, ESRD on HD, CAD, s\/p PCI at VHOC and Sipher stent to LAD (100% lesion) on 4\/10.

His clinical course is well known to you.\nHe has had a slight increase in peripheral edema. This has occurred\ndespite a medical regimen that includes Lasix 40 mg daily, aldactone 25\nmg daily, Coumadin, atenolol 25 mg daily, amiodarone 200 mg daily,\ninsulin, vancomycin that was recently discontinued, Zocor 80 mg daily,\nclonopin, Plavix, and glucophage.

He has been very stable\nclinically over these past six months. I believe this represents\na composite of the following three major changes in his medical\nregimen. As you know, we have discontinued all beta blockers,\nand this has been associated with a symptomatic stability. He\nhad biventricular pacing box placed, certainly contributing to\nhis overall improved status and he is now taking a regular dose\nof Lasix. He is on 80 mg alternating with 40 mg per day. He\ndoes have symptoms of fatigue, but his overall volume status is\nquite reasonable. He is currently on Aldactone 25 mg daily and\nLasix 80 mg per day alternating with 40 mg per day, Captopril\n6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d, Zocor, insulin, Glucophage, aspirin, and\nmexiletine. His amiodarone has been discontinued. He does have\nasymptomatic ventricular tachycardia, often paced out of this,\nbut I am reluctant to recommend ablation therapy for him at the\npresent time. He has not been shocked by his ICD.\n\nFunctionally he seems quite stable. He does have mild fatigue,\nbut is otherwise reasonably active. He will hopefully be\ntraveling to Miami this spring.\n\nPhysical examination today is of note for a weight of 184 lbs.\nHis blood pressure is 118\/70, his resting pulse 69. His neck\nveins are in fact, quite unimpressive. There is minimal jugular\ndistention, perhaps 6-7 cm. There is no hepatojugular reflux.\n\n\nRe: Brady Duvall\nMR #425-03-15-1 -2- 07\/18\/98\n\nLungs were clear. Examination of his heart reveals a quiet\nprecordium. S1 and S2 seem normal. No S3, no gallop and no\nmurmur or mitral regurgitation. Abdomen is benign without\npalpable liver or spleen and there was no peripheral edema.\nThere are bilateral varicosities.\n\nHis electrocardiogram shows pace rhythm.\n\nMr. Brady Duvall is currently stable on this regimen.\nAccordingly, I have made no changes. I have checked appropriate\nelectrolytes.\n\nMany thanks for letting us participate in his care.\n\nWith best regards.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nU. L.

Please see her current medication list. She also has a history of diabetes.\n\nOver the past few weeks to one month she has been having intermittent right shoulder pain. It is worse with lifting. The pain is in her deltoid muscle and radiates a little bit across her upper back. It is worse if she actually lies on her shoulder at night. There is no history of trauma, no neck pain, no upper extremity numbness or weakness except for occasional left thumb numbness. The thumb numbness resolves if she shakes her hand.\n\nShe is also having bilateral knee pain when she walks. There is no swelling or effusion or heat in her knees. She had been on Vioxx for her spinal stenosis but stopped it because it was not helping her spinal stenosis pain. Instead for her shoulder pain she has been taking Advil 200 mg 2 and up to 6 per day. She takes the Advil with food or milk and is not having any GI upset from it.\n\nShe is having a lot of stresses with her husband, whom she feels may have some early memory problems. His mini-mental status on his last exam was a 30\/40. However, he makes, according to her, arbitrary decisions, does not complete projects he starts, and not as task-oriented as he used to be. He does not complete tasks or shopping errands that she would like him to do. We discussed that he should make a follow-up appointment to see me to repeat his mini-mental status exam, but that some of these problems are not likely to be easily resolvable, and that she might benefit from finding ways to manage her anxiety and stress level. She does get very anxious and upset at times. She had been considering taking Ativan p.r.n. when she gets very upset and frustrated. She is also having stressors with her grandson, who lives next door and has a problem with substance abuse and questionable money issues.\n\nShe denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or edema. She is on her diabetes medication. She likes going to work because that gets her out of the house.\n\nON EXAMINATION: She is a pleasant, animated woman in no acute distress. Her blood pressure initially was 160\/80. After discussing her situation with her husband, her blood pressure was 180\/85. Neck supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs are clear without rales or rhonchi. Cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm and normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs. She has no peripheral edema.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\n(1) Hypertension, poor control. Will increase her Zestril to 40 mg p.o. q.d. Her daughter, Iyanna Field who is a registered nurse, will continue to monitor her blood pressure.\n(2) Right shoulder pain. On exam she has good range of motion of her shoulder and her muscle strength and reflexes are intact. She can continue the Advil p.r.n. but should take it with antacids or something to protect her stomach.\n\n(3) Adult-onset diabetes. We will check her Hemoglobin A1c.\n\nShe will follow up for her complete physical in May.\n\n\nIda Xayachack, M.D.\n\nIX\/delarosa\/austin\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2085-05-11\n\nNAME: Justus, Quiana MRN: 9814048\nQuiana is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes and spinal stenosis who comes in for a physical. She has spinal stenosis as documented by her prior MRI's. She can usually walk about 5 minutes and then develops pain in her thighs and calves. She has some knee pain with walking, but it is not consistent and does not occur after short 5-minute distances. The thigh and calf pain resolve with rest. She does not always have back pain with the thigh and calf pain. She also has occasional right lateral foot pain that feels like an achy arthritic pain in her foot. She takes Vioxx occasionally for that foot pain. She does not have any dysesthesias or numbness in her feet or hands. She has no recent trauma, fevers or chills. She has no change in her bowel or bladder.\nShe has type 2 diabetes. She has been taking Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. Her weight is stable. She does get annual ophthalmology evaluations.\nShe has a history of hypertension. She has not had any chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion or edema. Her blood pressure is never well controlled when she comes for her visits here, but her daughter, Iyanna Field, a nurse takes her blood pressure at home and she reports that it is typically 120\/70. She is currently on Propranolol LA 160 2 tabs p.o. q.d, Dyazide 1 tab p.o. q.d, Captopril 50 mg t.i.d.\nShe has a history of hyperlipidemia. She was intolerant of Lipitor in the past. She has been taking the Lopid 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. without complications. She does not do regular breast self-exams but has not noted any masses. She is status-post menopause. We discussed DEXA bone density scanning, but she did not want to do it at this time.\nWe also discussed colon cancer screening. For now she elects to do stool guaiacs x 3. She has not had any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena or hematochezia, abdominal pain or weight loss.\nPlease see her complete medication update in the LMR.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She is married. She drinks occasional but not excessive alcohol. She does not smoke. There is no history of domestic abuse.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Please see family history update in the LMR.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative.\nShe has not had a recent tetanus shot.\nPHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her blood pressure here is 150\/90. Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs are clear without wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Her breasts are without masses or adenopathy. Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or murmur. Abdomen is soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly. She is moderately obese. Her rectal exam is without masses. She has no spinal tenderness on palpation. Her lower extremity strength is 5\/5. She does not have any peripheral edema. Her distal pulses are 2+. Her sensation is intact to light touch in her feet.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n(1) Back pain with calf and thigh pain with walking. This is probably due to her spinal stenosis. However, she is at risk for claudication given her diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. We will check lower extremity noninvasive arterial studies to rule out claudication. She can take the Vioxx p.r.n. for her foot pain which I do not think is related.\n(2) Type 2 diabetes. She needs a hemoglobin A1c. Her blood pressure ideally should be under 130\/85. She reports that it is consistently below that level when her daughter checks it. She needs as chem-7. She has no evidence for neuropathy at this time.\n(3) Health maintenance. She needs a tetanus shot which she was given today. Will check stool guaiacs x 3.\nWe discussed calcium supplementation for osteoporosis prevention. She will follow up in six months and p.r.n. She has not had a recent tetanus shot. She was given a tetanus shot in the left deltoid without complications.\nIda Xayachack, M.D.\nIX\/delarosa\/bishop\n\n* Record date: 2087-09-11\n\n\n\nNAME: Justus, Quiana\nMRN: 9814048\n\nThe patient comes in today for follow up of several medical problems. She has a\nhistory of type 2 diabetes. Her sugars have not been optimally controlled. They are\nusually in the 190-200 range in the morning. Her weight is stable. She has no lower\nextremity numbness or weakness.\n\nShe has a history of hyperlipidemia. She stopped her Lescol 2 weeks ago because it\nwas expensive. She also never increased the dose above 20 mg. She has had side\neffects with atorvastatin and pravastatin in the past. Please see her allergy list in\nLMR.\n\nShe has a half sister who had colon cancer at age 88. Quiana has had rare\noccasional blood streaking when she wipes herself after being constipated. She is\naware of what a colonoscopy is but absolutely refuses a colonoscopy. She is aware\nthat she is at increased risk for colon cancer given her family history. She has no\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena or weight loss.\n\nShe has chronic lower back pain and bilateral leg pain that is probably due to spinal\nstenosis. She has lower back pain and pain in her legs that is worse with walking. It\nhelps when she uses a carriage to walk around in the store. She denies lower\nextremity numbness, change in her bowel or bladder, fevers or chills. Her last MRI\nwas done in Walsenburg in a wide body machine and was consistent with spinal stenosis.\nShe has taken Ultram. She is aware that Vioxx may increase people's risk for cardiac\ndisease and has stopped taking it. Dr. Yeager, her rheumatologist, referred her to Dr.\nNorth in Internal Medicine for possible injections.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: No acute distress. Her blood pressure is 180\/90. However, her\ndaughter,Iyanna Field, checks her blood pressure at home and it is very well controlled.\nThe patient gets very anxious here in the clinic. Neck supple without JVD or bruits.\nLungs clear without wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular,\nnormal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or murmurs. No C\/C\/E. Distal pulses intact.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\n(1) Type 2 diabetes. Check hemoglobin A1c. Continue current medications.\n\n(2) Hyperlipidemia. She should be on medication to keep her LDL below 100. She\nsaid that she would resume the medication.\n\n(3) Hypertension which is never well controlled on her visits here. Her daughter is\na nursing professional and does report that her blood pressure is very well controlled\nin the 120\/80 range when she checks at home. We will continue her current\nregimen.\n\n(4) Lower back pain. Probably secondary to spinal stenosis. She has an\nappointment with Dr. North.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIda Xayachack, M.D.\n\nIX\/delarosa\/bishop\n\n\n* Record date: 2091-03-19\n\nCCU Admission Note Patient Name: Justus, Quiana MR# 9814048 Location: Internal Medicine PCP: Xayachack, Ida, M.D. Date of Admission: 3\/18\/91 CC: STEMI\nHPI: 79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with new onset chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have lateral STEMI. It began last Sunday, when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by Monday. She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV. She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress. ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection. Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16.\nOn immediate LHC, a 100% occlusion of her OM1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS, resulting in TIMI 2 flow. Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 60% stenosis at most. LV ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis with moderate MR. An IABP was placed with her initial augmented diastolic pressures recorded in the 80s, which led to the initiation of Levophed, Dobutamine and Dopamine.\nA PAC was placed in the cath lab as well with her initial Wedge reported as 19-20, PAPs in the 50s.\nOn transfer to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated, being on IV Levophed at 20\/hr, Dobutamine at 200\/hr and Dopamine at 300\/hr. Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012. Her Temp. was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission. She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K. Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP. Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc\/hr. When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16\/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin. The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.\nPMHx: Hypertension DM type 2 Hyperlipidemia Iron deficiency anemia with pt refusing colonoscopy for several months DJD of hands - involving PIP's, DIP's, 1st CMC's.

Please see the recent note from cardiology from 06\/27\/2091. She is status post stenting in 03\/2091 and 06\/2091. Post her second procedure she also had a large hematoma which has been gradually resolving.\nShe has type 2 diabetes and her fasting sugars have been very well controlled. She is currently on metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. and glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. She is trying to watch her diet and salt intake. She has not had any symptoms of hypoglycemia. She had lost some weight after her first heart attack but her weight has been stable.\nHer lisinopril was recently increased by cardiology. She has no exertional chest pain, PND, orthopnea, edema, or claudication.\nShe has a history of iron deficiency anemia and had refused colonoscopies in the past. At the time of her heart attack she had been intubated and had some coffee grounds noted and also required a blood transfusion. She has not noted any epigastric pain, abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia. She does take her iron supplements and her stools are dark on the iron supplements. I had discussed with patient and daughter several times that she should get a colonoscopy to evaluate her guaiac iron deficiency anemia but she continues to refuse one.\nAlso noted on her admissions was that she had a lung nodule and possible pancreatic mass on CT from 03\/2091 and 06\/2091. She should get a repeat CT in 12\/2091.\nShe is not having any abdominal pain.\nShe has chronic back pain and osteoarthritis pain. Of note she also had elevated parathyroid levels in the past but refuses to see Endocrinology either in Fayetteville or at United Methodist Behavioral Hospital.\nPlease see her medication list which was reviewed with the patient and her daughter.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is in no acute distress. Blood pressure 132\/70. Neck: Supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs: Clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1 and S2. No S3, S4 or bruits. Abdomen: Mildly obese, soft, nontender. She still has some residual hematoma near her right groin. She has a left femoral artery bruit. The hematoma has significantly decreased in size compared to prior visit. No CCE. Distal pulses intact.\n1. Coronary artery disease. She has no symptoms of decompensated heart failure on her current regimen. Her blood pressure is well controlled with the recent increase in the lisinopril from 20 to 40 mg daily. Check Chem-7.\nHypomagnesemia. Check followup magnesium level.\nType 2 diabetes. Her last hemoglobin A1c was 6.1 which is excellent. Continue current medications. Iron deficiency anemia. She should have a colonoscopy +\/- an upper endoscopy but she declines these procedures. She is aware that we have not ruled out colon cancer or adenomatous colonic polyps or other cause for her iron deficiency anemia. Check CBC.\nHistory of lung nodule and possible pancreatic mass versus IPMN. These were both stable on imaging from 03\/2091 and 06\/2091. She needs repeat imaging in 6 months. She will follow up with me in 10\/2091 so we can get a flu shot and schedule these procedures.\n\nIda Xayachack, M.D.\n\n\ncc:\n\n\nTD: 07\/28\/2091 04:38:30 TR: 7999590 BackJob ID: 411287 VoiceJob ID: 17480048\n\n\n\n*","completion":"yes"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2121-05-09\nBCH EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT\n\nHOLCOMB,DENNIS 833-12-06-0 VISIT DATE: 05\/09\/21\nThis patient was seen, interviewed and examined by myself as well\nas Dr. Petty whose I have reviewed and whose findings I have\nconfirmed.\nHISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT: This is a 53-year-old male who\npresents with complaints of palpitations, shortness of breath and a\ngeneral feeling of weakness. The patient states he has been\nfeeling unwell for the past three days and has noticed his heart\nracing. He actually has had his significant other take his heart\nrate and blood pressure while he was at home, and his readings have\nbeen in the 1 teens to 120s. The patient has had a decreased\nappetite with vomiting and nausea as well as chest tightness in his\nmid-chest. The patient felt himself get worse, and he, therefore,\npresents to the emergency department.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per the written note.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.\nMEDICATIONS: Insulin.\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY: As per the written note.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a well-developed, well-nourished\nmale in moderate distress.

In addition to the above studies, the patient\nhad a chest x-ray which shows increased pulmonary vasculature. The\npatient's EKG along with his history is concerning for a\nventricular tachycardia. The patient, therefore, initially\nreceived amiodarone. The amiodarone affected no change in the\npatient's heart rate. The patient remained tachypneic and\ntachycardic and generally well appearing. The decision was made to\nproceed with cardioversion. The patient received morphine and\nAtivan and had a synchronized cardioversion once at 52 volts with\nimmediate change to sinus tachycardia in the 1 teens. The patient\nstated that his chest tightness resolved immediately following\ncardioversion. The patient received aspirin, beta-blockers, oxygen\nand heparin while in the emergency department. He is on amiodarone\ndrip. Individuals from the Cardiac Service were contacted\nregarding possibly getting the patient to the catheterization lab\nespecially in light of his ruling in for a myocardial infarction.\nThe plan at this time is for the patient to be admitted to the CCU,\nbe observed and then to proceed to cardiac catheterization\nthereafter.\nCONSULTATIONS (including PCP): Cardiac Service.\nFINAL DIAGNOSES:\n1.

He continues to work at Alaska Air and has multiple family obligations which are stressful to him. He has had no exertional neck, chest, arm, or jaw pain. He has not felt his AICD fire. He has had no lightheadedness or weakness. He continues on atenolol, aspirin, folate, furosemide, insulin, lisinopril, simvastatin and Viagra.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam today, his weight is 224, heart rate is 74 and blood pressure is 120\/77. There is no increase in jugular venous pressure. Carotids are without bruits. Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout. Cardiovascular exam is notable for nondisplaced PMI, S1, physiologically split S2 with systolic ejection murmur and a soft holosystolic apical murmur. Abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits. Extremities are warm and free of edema with symmetric pulses, motor strength, and sensation.\n\nLABORATORY DATA: EKG is notable for sinus with evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: In summary, Dennis has been doing well with respect to his blood pressure control and exercise. Given his current levels of stress, we are going to change his atenolol to 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night, and I have encouraged him to get to a target weight of 190 this year, and I am making no other changes in his medical regimen.\n\n\n\nEvelyn Maxwell-Johnston, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:5-3853809 IFFocus\n\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2128-02-26\n\n\n\nLynchburg City Health Department\n7609 New Hampshire Avenue\nKigali, NJ 47798\n497-045-1949\n\nHOLCOMB, DENNIS\n83312060\n02\/26\/2128\n\nDATE OF BIRTH: 12\/14\/67\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: He presents today for his annual history and physical after an absence to this office for the past 2 years.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, currently on insulin for the past 33 years, history of left foot infection, erectile dysfunction, onychomycosis of toenails, hyperlipidemia, CAD, inferior myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular tachycardia, obesity, diabetic retinopathy, ischemic cardiomyopathy and low testosterone.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Include cardiac catheterization, coronary stenting and implantable cardiac defibrillator.\n\nDRUG ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Include atenolol 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the evening, aspirin 81 mg 2 tablets daily, folic acid 1 mg daily, furosemide 40 mg daily, NPH 40-42 units once daily, regular insulin for sliding scale, lisinopril 5 mg daily, multivitamin once daily, simvastatin 20 mg at bedtime, B12 250 mcg by mouth daily, vitamin C 1000 units daily, and over-the-counter cholesterol-lowering medication.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Father and brother died of cerebral aneurysms, both were hypertensive and smokers, there is also history of cardiac disease in his grandparents.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Single, works for the Alaska Air Group in Juneau, drinks 1-2 beers a year. He is a nonsmoker, does not use IV drugs, he is responsible to take care of several sick individuals that are very close to his life, therefore he claims he cannot attention to his own personal health because of caring for others.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presents today for annual physical. The patient states he has become enlightened recently that when he goes to Tim Horton's, they pretreated his coffee with sugar as a role and he thinks that is the reason for his diabetic, lack of control over the years. He has been eliminating concentrated sweets in his diet. After a while, his blood sugars have gotten much better by his report. He recently had an eye examination showing stable background retinopathy without any recent changes. He has had no active podiatry issues over the past 2 months has had no recent chest pain, shortness of breath or PND. He sees Dr. Isaac Ulibarri for a cardiomyopathy standpoint. With his AICD everything seems to be working fine according to him when they interrogate his device. He reports no fever, shakes, chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Again, he has had no recent chest pain, PND, or orthopnea. He has had no dysphagia, odynophagia, melena, hematemesis, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria or polyuria.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure is 126\/70 in the right arm, temperature 95.6, pulse 78, respirations are 16, O2 sat 97% on room air. He is 67 inches tall, 222 pounds. BMI 34.8. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils are equally round and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were intact. He has had minimal wax buildup bilaterally. TMs were intact. Oropharynx was clear without erythema or exudate. Sinuses were nontender. Nostrils were patent. Neck is supple Supple without JVD, lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rubs or rhonchi. Heart regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended. He has a small umbilical hernia that is not protruding and bowel sounds are active. He has no organomegaly and there is no CVA tenderness. Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema. He does have significant thickening and brittleness of the toenails of both feet consistent with onychomycosis. He has no open sores of the feet. Neurologically, he is alert and oriented x3 and grossly nonfocal with intact distal sensation to light touch in both feet. He has no generalized lymphadenopathy and his joint examination shows no effusions or erythema.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Annual physical, preventative maintenance. The patient had a colonoscopy in 2125 and was told to come back in 2130 because of benign polyps. I did recommend guaiac stool cards today for home testing purposes. Immunizations are up-to-date. He did receive an H1N1 and a seasonal flu vaccine through his employer and for private pharmacies. His Pneumovax is due to be a booster in 2 years' time. We are recommending a PSA and a DRE annually starting today. Labs were also drawn in the office for CBC, CMP, and lipid profile. The patient is declining Zostavax at this time. We will recommend a followup in 1 year for an annual physical.\n2. Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The patient has now eliminated concentrated sweets from his diet, although I do suspect dietary noncompliance beyond table sugar. Recommend checking a hemoglobin A1c today, urine for microalbumin, lipid panel and creatinine as well as a BUN and a GFR. I would recommend continuing his insulin NPH 42 units daily, but we may need to recommend an endocrine consult if his A1c remains elevated despite dietary improvement. We did recommend aggressive weight loss and exercise as this is a major impediment to his glucose control. I would recommend follow up in 3 to 4 months.\n3. Obesity. We will check a TSH, lipid panel and glucose to ensure that he is in good metabolic balance. I do suspect continued poorly controlled diabetes given his past history.\n4. CAD with history of DVT. He has had an ICD interrogated recently. We will check a lipid panel today. We would like to strive for an LDL less than 70 given his high risk status, I would recommend changing his steroid to a higher dose if required at that point.\n\n\n\nRobert Lincoln, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-37751462 JSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 02\/26\/28\nDT: 02\/26\/28\nDV: 02\/26\/28\n\n* Record date: 2129-02-19\nLee County Community Hospital0021 New Hampshire AvenueKigali, NJ 47798497-045-1949\n\n\nDennis Holcomb Medical record #83312060 Date of visit-February 19, 2129\n\nDate of birth: December 14, 2067\nChief complaint: The patient presents today in follow up for his diabetes and coronary disease, as well as a reevaluation of his recent left proximal humeral fracture\n\nProblems Diabetes mellitus type 2 : insulin requiring H\/O left foot infection Erectile dysfunction Onychomycosis Hyperlipidemia Coronary artery disease inferior myocardial infarction H\/O Ventricular tachycardia Obesity diabetic retinopathy ischemic cardiomyopathy low testosterone Polyp of colon Fracture of humerus\nProcedures Cardiac catheterization Coronary stent : rca stent, ptca of diagonal Implanted cardiac defibrillator\n\nAllergies NKA\nMedications Atenolol 100 MG (100MG TABLET Take 1) PO QAM, to be taken in conjunction with 50 mg tab at qhs #90 Tablet(s) Atenolol 50 MG (50MG TABLET Take 1) PO QHS, to be taken in conjunction with 100 mg qam #90 Tablet(s) Enteric Coated Aspirin (ASPIRIN Enteric Coated) 81MG TABLET DR Take 2 PO QD #Tablet(s) Folate (FOLIC Acid) 1 MG (1MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD #Tablet(s) Furosemide 40 MG (40MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD #90 Tablet(s) Insulin Nph Human 40 UNITS SC QD #4 Bottle(s) Insulin Regular Human Variable (100 U\/ML VIAL ML) SC #2 Bottle(s) Lisinopril 5 MG (5MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD #90 Tablet(s) Mvi (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 TAB PO QD Simvastatin 20 MG (20MG TABLET Take 1) PO QHS #90 Tablet(s) Ultram (TRAMADOL) 50 MG TABLET PO Q4-6H PRN pain, 1-2 tabs before bedtime and as needed, max of 300 mg per day #60 Tablet(s) Vitamin B12 (CYANOCOBALAMIN) 250 MCG (250 MCG TABLET Take 1) PO QD #Tablet(s) Vitamin E (TOCOPHEROL-DL-ALPHA) 1000 UNIT CAPSULE PO QD #Capsule(s)\nFamily \/ Social History Cerebral Aneurysm: Relative: Father; Hypertension: Cardiac: Relative: Grandmother, maternal; Relative: Grandfather, maternal;\nSocial history: Engaged, does not smoke, drink or use drugs, works as a architect at the Alaska Air Group in Juneau\nHistory of Present Illness: The patient presents today for follow up of his diabetes and heart disease, and to follow up as well as recent proximal humeral fracture that will not require surgery per his orthopedic specialist. The patient fell down a couple weeks ago on ice and landed on his left shoulder, sustaining a proximal humeral fracture that is currently well aligned. The patient was seen by orthopedics at the Boulder County Hospital, he was told to have no work for the next 3 months. He also received reports no chest pain, PND or orthopnea, he also denies any AICD firing, and reports only occasional low blood sugar reactions. He has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, he currently uses NPH insulin 42 units daily with sliding scale to 3 times a day at a maximal 8 units at a time. He reports no polyuria or polydipsia. His only risk doctor for fracture includes a low testosterone diagnosed about 3 years ago.

As you will remember he recently underwent right carotid endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty after treatment of a severe underlying pneumonia. He returns today reporting that he is doing well from a neurologic standpoint. He has had no focal, motor, sensory deficits, and no amaurosis fugax. A follow up duplex examination performed in our vascular laboratory reveals mild right ICA disease after his carotid endarterectomy with moderate left ICA stenosis which should be followed over time.\n\nAssessment and plan: Overall, I am extremely pleased with Mr. Pearson's outcome given his high risk pulmonary status. It would be prudent to see him again in follow up evaluation in six months' time with a repeat carotid duplex examination.

Of note, he was hospitalized from May 26 until May 29 for a COPD flare, and was discharged home at that time on a prednisone taper, which he completed about one week ago. He was in his usual state of good health and had even spent the past weekend with family in Connecticut camping. But on the evening of June 13 he began to feel short of breath, without cough or chest pain, and the dyspnea was made worse with exertion. Not made worse with lying down. He also had a fever to 103, without mental status changes. EMS was called and in the field he was noted to be breathing at a rate in the 40s; he was given a dose of IV lasix and he put out 600cc of urine. He was then brought to the WMC ED where he continued to display labored breathing, breathing in the 40s, afebrile, tachycardic to 147bpm. An ABG on BIPAP showed 7.35\/53\/100. His blood pressure dropped from systolic 130s to 70\/50, and so he was subsequently intubated, and a central and arterial lines placed. He was given approximately 2L of NS with resultant CVP of 11. He was also started on dopamine, which was eventually transitioned to norepinephrine. He was given vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl, as well as a dose of solumedrol. He was then transferred to the Internal Medicine.\nReview of Systems: per HPI; no changes in mental status; no cough, chest pain, palpitations; no N\/V\/C\/D; no BRBPR or melena; no sick contacts.\nPast Medical History COPD on home O2 2LNC at all times, never been intubated Cerebrovascular disease: s\/p R CEA, and with L ICA on aspirin DM2 Lung cancer: s\/p L partial resection BPH PTSD\nMedications on Admission Albuterol and atrovent nebulizers prn Advair 250\/50 2puffs bid ASA 325mg po qd Calcium and vitamin D 250mg po bid Lasix 10mg po qd Neurontin 300mg po tid Guaifenasin 10mL tid Zantac 150mg po bid Senna 2tabs bid Zocor 20mg po qhs Losartan 100mg po qd Toprol XL 100mg po qd Loratidine 10mg po qd\nAllergies: bactrim and tetracycline, reactions unknown\nSocial History: retired Civil Engineer, positive asbestos exposure; quit smoking 30 years ago; no EtOH or illicits\nFamily History: denies any known family history of lung disease, COPD, CAD, or cancer\nPhysical Exam Gen: NAD, appears comfortable VS: T96.1 bp118\/60 without pressors P93 CVP 6-9 O2sat 97% on mechanical ventilation HEENT: R eye not reactive to light; L eye 3 2mm with light; EOMI Neck: supple, JVP flat Pulm: ronchi bilaterally without wheezing or crackles Cor: regular, nls1s2, no mumurs Abd: soft, NTND, +BS, no HSM Ext: trace lower edema bilaterally; warm, DP 2+ B Neuro: no focal findings, pt appropriate; CN 2-12 intact, tongue midlines, strength 5\/5 all extremities, toes downgoing\nLabs\nDate\/Time NA K CL CO2 06\/14\/2132 4.3 06\/14\/2132 138 4.1 101 29.1 Date\/Time BUN CRE GLU 06\/14\/2132 132 (H) 06\/14\/2132 30 (H) 1.6 (H) 123 (H)\nDate\/Time CA PHOS MG TBILI 06\/14\/2132 9.4 4.1 1.4 0.9 Date\/Time DBILI TP ALB GLOB 06\/14\/2132 0.0 6.7 3.4 3.3 Date\/Time LACT 06\/14\/2132 1.2\nDate\/Time TEMP FIO2 bPO2 bPCO2 06\/14\/2132 37.0 1.00 100 (H) 53 (H) Date\/Time bPH 06\/14\/2132 7.35\nDate\/Time ALT\/SGPT AST\/SGOT ALKP TBILI 06\/14\/2132 16 22 54 0.9 Date\/Time NT-BNP CK-MB TROP-I 06\/14\/2132 NEGATIVE NEGATIVE 06\/14\/2132 325\nDate\/Time PT PT-INR PTT 06\/14\/2132 12.8 1.0 26.8\nDate\/Time WBC RBC HGB HCT 06\/14\/2132 22.9 (H) 4.89 14.1 42.9 Date\/Time MCV MCH MCHC PLT 06\/14\/2132 88 28.9 32.9 190 Date\/Time DIFFR METHOD %NEUT %LYMPH 06\/14\/2132 RECEIVED Auto 82 (H) 15 (L)\nDate\/Time UA-GLUC UA-KET UA-SPGR UA-BLD 06\/14\/2132 NEGATIVE NEGATIVE 1.015 NEGATIVE\nDate\/Time UA-PH UA-PROT UA-NIT UA-WBC 06\/14\/2132 5.0 NEGATIVE NEGATIVE NEGATIVE\n06\/14\/2132 07:10 CXR Right upper lobe and right middle lobe opacity, new since 5\/27\/2132, suspicious for pneumonia.

As you know, he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease, for which I ended up doing a catheterization on 08\/27\/2157, and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain. At that time, he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer, who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia, a low workload of 3 minutes and 18 seconds, and a heart rate of only 72% of predicted. The LV chamber was dilated, and the ejection fraction was estimated at 48%, and there was a suggestion of global ischemia. The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease, plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree, some calcification, and narrow caliber vessels overall, but no focal high-grade stenoses. There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery, but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply.\n\nHe was treated medically for the coronary artery disease. At the time of his cath, he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg, because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time. That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side, a small superior one that was narrowed by about 50%, and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about 60%. The right side was patent. With respect to the abdominal aorta, there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery, narrowing the channel in the aorta by about 30% or 40%. The iliac vessels were patent, and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent. The left SFA, a diffusely diseased vessel, had a high-grade stenosis of about 80% in the adductor canal. Then, at the trifurcation, there was occlusion or high-grade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side. There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle.\n\nThe decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively, at least for the present, since he was still playing golf three to four times a week. He also apparently had some other issues, so I never saw him again in followup. The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA.\n\nHe did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis. Dr. Anders Sykes performed an L3-L4, L4-L5 decompressive laminectomy. This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain.\n\nThe biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased. He has been an avid golfer in the past, but is now having some more difficulty with that. Even when I saw him two years ago, he was using a cart to play three or four times a week. He still is able to play golf, but if he walks about 100 yards, he starts feeling his calves, and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal. He also has some numbness in his toes, which is constant, and his feet feel cold much of the time. The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years.\n\nHis blood pressure has been reasonably stable. He tells me that you get pressures of 120-130. He has not been taking his blood pressure at home, but he does take a fair amount of medication, see below.\n\nOf note, his son says that when he was in Michigan, he was playing 18 holes of golf regularly, sometimes a couple of times per day, but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan. He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago. He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move, and if he does not play any golf at all, he will really deteriorate. Of note, the discomfort is not only limited to the calves, but also there is some discomfort in the hips, though not nearly as bad and not as limiting.\n\nOf note, he has been seeing Dr. Youngman for his legs and has been told to walk walk walk. At this point, he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions.\n\nPast medical history:\nAs above.\nOthers include the following:\n1. Diabetes, type 2.\n2. Hypertension, with blood pressures as high as 220 at times in the past.\n3. Carotid bruits, though I do not have any readings from a Duplex ultrasound that was done a couple of years ago or so.\n4. Hyperlipidemia.\n5. Remote history of smoking, quit 40 years ago or so after 20 years of smoking.\n6. Peripheral neuropathy.\n7. Coronary artery disease, as described.\n8. Renal artery stenosis and PVD.\n\nCurrent Medications:\nAvandia 4 mg QD\nPrilosec 20 mg QD\natenolol 150 mg QD\nImdur 60 mg QD\nlisinopril 40 mg QD\nLipitor 5 mg QD\nmetformin hydrochloride 500 mg 4 tabs qd\nglyburide 5 mg 2 tabs qd\naspirin 325 mg QD\nTricor 54 mg 1 tab qd\nNorvasc 5 mg QD\nPlavix 75 mg QD\nnitroglycerin PRN\nLasix 40 mg QD\n\nSocial history:\nHe used to run a catering company. Currently retired. Plays golf a lot. Likes to maintain a high level of activity. Has two sons, one in Lake Wildwood, another in Baldwin City. He has a daughter in Michigan. Grandchildren - several. He also has a great grandchild.\n\nNo smoking currently and only drinks occasional beer. Occasional cup of coffee.\n\nReview of systems:\nPositive for edema, 1+ in both legs. He denies neurologic symptoms, sweats, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, or hemoptysis. He does have night cramps and frequent urination at night. He says he has some problems with vision with some intermittent blurring of his vision, but no monocular blindness. He is set up to see an ophthalmologist soon.\n\nPhysical examination:\n-Pulse: 64 and regular\n-BP: 160\/65 by my nurse, but I retook it at 130\/60\n-General: He is a well-appearing gentleman, looks younger than his age of 82 years\n-Heent: Normal. EOMI. PERRL\n-Neck: Carotid upstrokes normal. Bilateral bruits present, soft. No JVD\n-Chest: Clear\n-Cardiac: Normal S1 and S2, soft S4, and a grade 1-2\/6 murmur in the left lower sternal border\n-Abdomen: Soft, positive bruit, no organomegaly, and no enlargements of the aorta\n-Extremities: Femoral pulses 2+, bilateral bruits. Below this, feet are warm and well perfused, with 1+ edema bilaterally. Trace pulses in the dorsalis pedis on both sides, not sure how well I am feeling them. Popliteal pulses are trace to 1+. No ulcers or gangrene. No tissue loss\n\nEKG:\n- normal sinus rhythm at 64. Normal axis and intervals, very minor nonspecific ST-T wave abnormality, essentially normal tracing.\n\nOther Data:\nDate of Birth: 01\/22\/2077\n\nAssessment and plan:\n1. Obtain MRA of abdominal aorta, renal, and run-off arteries down to the ankle. This will help give us a road map as to how we can approach revascularization of his legs to make him feel better. I already know that I can open up his left SFA and probably his left trifurcation vessels below the knee, but I would like to see the right side and also get another look at the aortoiliac vessels, since it has been a full two years.\n2. Continue appropriate risk factor modification as you are doing.\n3. We will obtain blood work today in preparation for revascularization.\n4. I need to get carotid noninvasive studies, since it has been a couple of years anyway.\n\nImpression:\n1. Peripheral arterial disease - progressive claudication, now involving both legs at an equal amount and limiting him in terms of daily activities. We know that he has high-grade disease in the left leg, below the groin, which can be treated. Right leg has not been examined in the past. Also has an ulcerative plaque in the aorta, which might be best left alone.\n2. Renal vascular disease - known moderately severe stenosis left main and accessory renal arteries. Blood pressure is under reasonable control. Need to check his creatinine and BUN. If they are okay, then we would leave him alone. He is however on a total of six antihypertensive medications, so consideration of renal artery revascularization is certainly something to entertain.\n3. Coronary artery disease - stable.\n4. Diabetes.\n5. Spinal stenosis - better since back surgery.\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\nAvandia 4 mg QD\nPrilosec 20 mg QD\natenolol 150 mg QD\nImdur 60 mg QD\nlisinopril 40 mg QD\nLipitor 5 mg QD\nmetformin hydrochloride 500 mg 4 tabs qd\nglyburide 5 mg 2 tabs qd\naspirin 325 mg QD\nTricor 54 mg 1 tab qd\nNorvasc 5 mg QD\nPlavix 75 mg QD\nnitroglycerin PRN\nLasix 40 mg QD\n\nThank you so much for allowing me to participate in the care of this nice gentleman.

Urology Consult Note\nPatient Name: Michael Yee PH#: 69044681 Date\/Time: 12\/24\/94; 2:30 PM Attending: Dr. Quintrell Ferreira\nCC: presumed UTI in the setting of indwelling B ureteral stents\nHPI: 77M w\/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction (diagnosed 10\/93 in the setting of B hydroureteronephrosis and ARF) managed initially with B ureteral stents (most recently changed 2\/26\/94), currently admitted to the medical service 12\/23\/94 with FTT, anemia, hyperkalemia, and a presumed UTI.\nHe was brought to the PH ED yesterday by his wife, who noted that he was lethargic and confused for 3 days (reportedly similar to previous UTI presentations). She felt that his urine output had decreased at home, and that his urine had been foul-smelling for two days. He was treated empirically with levofloxacin and transfused 2U PRBC for HCT 26. His Cr was elevated at 3.1, and his K was 6.4. He was admitted to a telemetry bed on the medical service for management of the above issues. The patient has been hemodynamically stable, and his only subjective complaint has been general malaise.\nWe are consulted with the question of whether his stents may be changed during his current admission.\nPMH: Duchenne&#8217;s muscular dystrophy, COPD (2.5L home O2), IDDM, recurrent UTIs w\/ previous Candida tropicalis fungemia (followed by Dr. Phoebe Abreu), B ureteral obstruction s\/p ureteral stent placement, CAD s\/p CABG, PVD, SZ disorder, hyperkalemia secondary to hyperaldosteronemia (type III RTA), CRI (baseline 1.5)\nPSH: CABG; cystoscopy, B RPG, B ureteral stent placement 11\/93; cystoscopy, B ureteral stent change 2\/94\nMED: vancomycin, ceftriaxone, fluconazole, lactulose, senna, kayexalate, tramadol, sarna, nystatin, paxil, lipitor, lantus, humalog ISS, keppra, labetalol, meclizine, prilosec\nALL: PCN\nPE: AVSS NAD; alert, responsive, and interactive S\/NT\/ND Phallus uncircumcised w\/ easily retractible foreskin; meatus WNL Testes descended bilaterally and nontender Foley to gravity draining clear urine with sediment\nLABS: Chem7 (12\/24) &#8211; 137\/6.0\/108\/16\/83\/2.7\/79 CBC (12\/24) &#8211; 6.4\/33.4\/233 Coags (12\/24) &#8211; 13\/58\/1.1 U\/A (12\/23) &#8211; 305W, >100R, tr LE, neg NIT, 1+ bac, + pro, lg heme UCx (12\/23) &#8211; NGSF\nRADS: CT A\/P W\/O CONTRAST &#8211; pending\nA\/P: 77M w\/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction, now admitted w\/ ARF, hyperkalemia, anemia, and a presumed UTI.

His ureteral stents were last changed 2\/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction. His abdominal CT is pending. He remains clinically stable, with significantly improved cognition and awareness since admission. As such, we recommend: --F\/U UCx and ID recs, as you are doing. --F\/U CT A\/P to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis. Depending on the results of this study, we will consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal. Regardless of his eventual stent plan, he should be medically cleared for an operative procedure, which would entail stabilization of his hyperkalemia prior to undergoing anaesthesia.\nD\/w Dr. Ferreira, who agrees with above plan.

She does note that her blood sugars at home have been consistently elevated to the 200-300 range.\nIn the ED, Ms. Fay was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She was evaluated by the GI department. A screening HIV test was negative. She was found to have mild hyponatremia and mild hyperkalemia, as well as a question of subtle ECG changes.

The presence of thrush raises suspicion for esophageal candidiasis, though she does not report odynophagia. Mechanical obstruction should be ruled out. The presence of mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is likely attributable to the fact that she abruptly discontinued exogenous corticosteroids after a several week course; she is hemodynamically stable. Finally, there is little here to suggest acute coronary syndrome, though she falls into a subgroup of patients more likely to present with minimal symptoms. ECG warrants following. Diabetes is poorly controlled and may require initiation of insulin therapy; though sugars here may have been confounded by the dose of steroids given in ED.\nCV: CR monitor overnight; cycle ECG and cardiac biomarkers; aspirin, continue beta blocker Pulm: No issues; albuterol prn GI: Upper endoscopy tentatively planned for the morning; NPO after midnight; continue home ppi Endocrine: Sliding scale insulin, metformin; consider diabetes education, and discuss with PCP whether initiation of insulin is warranted.

Betty Gillis is a very pleasant 73-year-old woman who was recently admitted to the Griffin Memorial Hospital in early February 2085 with a right MCA territory stroke characterized clinically by drooling and left hand weakness. Fortunately, her symptoms have now resolved and she is back to her regular activities. We understand that she has also had previous strokes. In December 2082, she was suffering a dizzy spell and subsequently an MRI of her brain found a posterior circulation cerebellar infarct as well as a couple of basal ganglia lacunar infarct. She recalls having only V2 clinical events.\nShe was worked up in the Griffin Memorial Hospital and had a Holter, which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with minor ectopy only, an echocardiogram, which was reported as essentially normal with the exception of a positive saline contrast bubble study suggesting a patent foramen ovale, an MRI of her head which demonstrated the infarct and marked microvascular disease, as well as a CT angiogram of her head and neck arteries, which demonstrated mild atheroma for the most part with a left internal carotid artery stenosis that was less than 50%. She is referred to us today for an opinion as to how to manage the possible patent foramen ovale.\nThis lady has never had cardiac problems otherwise. There is no history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure. She does not get exertional chest discomfort (chest pain or shortness of breath) and has no history of syncope or presyncope. She has no history of PND, orthopnea or edema. She remains fairly active despite her ataxic gait. She tells me that she is able to walk several blocks without difficulty and never has any exertional chest pains or shortness of breath. Moreover, she does not have claudication. Functional inquiry is otherwise unremarkable save for her usual difficulties with psoriasis and eczema. She denies difficulties with heartburn or GI bleeding recently.\nPast Medical History: 1. Stroke. A. Subcortical basal ganglia stroke. B. Cerebellar stroke in December 2085 with subsequent ataxic gait. C. Right MCA stroke with left hand weakness in February 2085. 2. Hypertension 3. Dyslipidemia. 4. Insulin insensitivity 5. Ex-smoker (1-1-1\/2 packs per day for approximately 40 years, quit approximately 12 years ago). 6. Possible patent foramen ovale. 7. Degenerative joint disease\/osteoarthritis. A. Status bilateral total knee replacement in 2084. B. Gastroesophageal reflux disease\/hiatus hernia. C. Status post GI bleeding (query secondary to esophagitis) 8. Osteoporosis. 9. Bladder incontinence.\nThere is no history of other cardiac problems. There is no history of venous thromboembolic disease. This lady has not had frank diabetes.\nAllergies: She has no known drug allergies.\nCurrent Medical Therapy: 1. Aggrenox 25\/200 p.o. b.i.d. 2. Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily. 3. Doxepin 25 mg daily. 4. Simvastatin 40 mg p.o. daily. 5. Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. daily. 6. Fosamax 70 mg every week. 7. BLANK 1 tab daily. 8. Darifenacin 7.5 mg daily.\nFamily History: Betty Gillis is adopted and does not know very much about her biological parents. She believes that her biological father suffered a stroke at some point, but cannot say for certain how old he was.\nSocial History: This woman is single. She is a retired Secretary. She is an ex-smoker (more than 40 pack years), but does not drink significant amounts of alcohol. She has no other history of substance abuse.\nReview of Systems: Functional inquiry is positive for difficulties with psoriasis that are chronic and ongoing. She has no other new symptoms. There is no recent GI bleeding. She has difficulties with bladder incontinence as well.\nOn physical examination today, her heart rate is 86 beats per minute and regular and her blood pressure is 122\/78 in the right arm and 124\/80 in the left arm. Respiratory rate is 20 and she is pink on room air. Head and neck exam is unremarkable. There are no carotid bruits. She has some kyphoscoliosis of her spine. Her chest examination reveals no dullness to percussion and vesicular breath sounds only. Her jugular venous pressure is not elevated. Central pulses are normal in volume and contour. Her apex beat is within normal limits. Heart sounds include a normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs. Her abdomen is soft and nontender. There are no obvious masses. Her aorta does not obviously appear to be enlarged. Her pulses are palpable in her groin, but hard to feel behind her knees and distally. They are symmetrical. Informally, ABI test was not done today because she has several weeping eczematous lesions on her legs, which reflects psoriasis that has been excoriated. A brief neurologic exam reveals dysmetria worse on the left than the right.\nImpression: Betty Gillis has had at least four strokes and has documented evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease and cerebromicrovascular disease on recent imaging. We reviewed the echocardiogram today and we wished to confirm with the reading echocardiographer that it is indeed positive. (It does not look particularly positive to our eyes). Certainly, if she does not indeed have a patent foramen ovale, there is no issue as to what to do about it. If she does have one; however, it seems more likely that her strokes reflect her atherosclerotic vascular disease secondary to her atherosclerotic risk factors and that the bulk of treatment should be directed at modulating those.\nHer hypertension is controlled today. Her dyslipidemia is not bad. However, the LDL is 76 and perhaps there is some added benefit to increasing her simvastatin to 80 mg p.o. daily. We also note that she has had elevated glucoses in the past, as high as 191, as well as an elevated hemoglobin A1c up to 6.5. It is probably worth having her screen formally to see whether or not she has type 2 diabetes mellitus versus insulin insensitivity only. She may benefit from an oral hypoglycemic.\nWe recommend. 1. We will review the echocardiogram with the reading echocardiographer to ensure that it does indeed show a patent foramen ovale. 2. We suggest that she increase her statin from simvastatin 40 mg p.o. daily to simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily. We will leave this to her primary care physician to organize. 3. We suggest that she be screened formally for diabetes mellitus type 2.\nWe will see her again as necessary, but for the time being, we have no plans to perform an intervention on this lady.\nBobby Elston Braun, MD\n\n\neScription document:8-3518405 IFFocus\nCC: Michael John Boyle MD 687 SCOTIA WAY BIG BEAR LAKE, CO 17347\nDD: 04\/22\/85 DT: 04\/23\/85 DV: 04\/22\/85\n\n* Record date: 2085-08-31\nEDVISIT^78865189^GILLIS, BETTY^08\/31\/85^GUEVARA, ELIZABETH\nThe patient was seen with Dr. Izaguirre.

While her deficits appear to have resolved, arguing against stroke, she clearly has multiple punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that would be consistent with acute stroke. These strokes are in the PCA region and at the watershed region of the MCA\/PCA and so could represent both anterior and posterior circulation emboli. Given that her carotid arteries are relatively clear, her heart or arch may be possible sources of embolus.\n- Has had stroke workup in the past that has been unrevealing\n- Would benefit from a repeat echocardiogram to assess for any new vegetations or thrombi\n- Would also benefit from repeat Holter to assess for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\n- Admit to Internal Medicine service\n\nVictor Q.

Otherwise, she denies CP, cough, fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (other than the episode in the ambulance), change in bowel\/bladder habits. No exacerbating or alleviating symptoms. Of note, she has some residual left sided weakness from her prior R MCA stroke and some balance issues from her cerebellar stroke.\n\nIn the ED the patient was tachypnic with SATS in the low 80s and placed on oxygen by nasal cannula with improved sats on 4L to the mid 90s. Then was able to be weaned to room air with sats still in the mid 90s. She also was tachycardic to the 90s with BPs to the 90\/60 with one episode of BP to 78 systolic. She responded well to fluid with 2L in the ED and improved BPs. CT showed stable RP and rectus sheath hematomas, no evidence of DVT or iliac thrombosis, and no evidence of PE. CXR was clear.\n\nOf note, following her hospitalization at PROMPTCARE in July 2087 for TIA where she was found to have a small PFO and iliac vein thrombosis, she was started on Coumadin. However, the patient was recently admitted to GMH with rectus sheath and RP hematoma. Per the patient, she received 8 U PRBC there. She also received FFP and vitamin K to reverse her Coumadin. During her hospitalization she was in the ICU for hypotension and tachycardia. An IVC filter was placed initially but subsequently d\/c&#8217;d on 8\/26\/87. She was discharged off of anticoagulation.\n\n\nPMH\/PSH:\nR MCA stroke: 02\/85\nR cerebellar stroke: 12\/85\nOsteoarthritis s\/p bilateral knee replacements\nGERD, chronic GI bleed with anemia\nHTN\nHLD\nBladder incontinence\n?Iliac vein thrombosis\nRectus sheath hematoma\/Retroperitoneal hematoma\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\nOmeprazole 40 MG PO Daily\nAtenolol 12.5 MG PO Daily\nSimvastatin 40 MG PO Every night\nFerrous Sulfate 324 MG PO Two times a day\n\nALLERGIES:\nNKDA\n\nFHX: Unknown, adopted.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nLives on her own in Big Bear Lake.

The patient denies shortness of\nbreath. She has no nausea, vomiting, and no fevers or chills.\nShe says that she has occasionally had these symptoms in the\npast, they have already stopped on their own. Tonight, they\nlasted for approximately 30 minutes prior to calling EMS. En\nroute EMS took 12-lead ECG showing a rate of 150, suspected a\nflutter and was given 20 mg diltiazem by EMS with no response.\nShe describes feeling in her left arm as dull pain, it is 3\/10,\nand it has not made better or worse by anything.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Please see paper chart.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Please see paper chart.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Please see paper chart.\nMEDICATIONS: Please see paper chart.\nALLERGIES: Please see paper chart.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Reviewed and noncontributory.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A middle-aged African-American woman,\nawake, alert, and in mild distress.

Back is nontender.\nMusculoskeletal: No lower extremity swelling or edema.\nNeuropsychiatric: Oriented x3. Mood and affect is normal.\nCranial nerves II through XII tested and intact. No motor or\nsensory deficits.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: Initial EKG showed a rate of about\n150, unclear. It seemed that there was T waves in V3. There is\nno evidence of ST elevation MI. We thought this could be an SVT.\nIt was not really consistent with an atrial fibrillation. Our\nplan was to give adenosine, however, during the IV placement.\nPrior to giving adenosine, the patient converted to a normal\nsinus rhythm with mild tachycardia at around 100, but it was\nclear that there was T waves. At this point, we decided to give\nher baseline metoprolol dose and she missed two doses.\nLABORATORY DATA: Labs checked include sodium of 139, potassium\n3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 14, creatinine 0.81,\nglucose 268.

White blood cells 10.29, hematocrit\n42.7, and platelets 438, 000. INR is 1. UA is negative for\ninfection with trace blood present.\nPLAN: Our plan is to check two more enzymes because the patient\nhad the left arm heaviness during the palpitations. If both of\nthose enzymes are negative, we feel that she is safe to go home\nfrom the ED Observation Unit. It is unclear the etiology of her\narrhythmia. It did seem to be likely SVT, which broke\nspontaneously.

Also with a history of borderline hypertension previously on hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. q.d. for the last year, which he discontinued last Sunday, who now comes in because over the last two to three weeks he has been having trouble with increased dizziness and headaches, and he is afraid that his sugar is up. He states that over the last two or three weeks, he gets stars and floaters and sometimes halos of light followed by mild headaches. He says that the visual changes are usually accompanied by the headache, and the headache is usually relieved with Excedrin in 5 minutes to an hour. He does admit to a history of migraines but states that in the past his migraines have been much more severe than this, though the visual aura is very similar to his previous migraine aura. He states that he was seen in the emergency room on 1-12, at which time they did a finger stick which was about 180, and they told him to come to this appointment at this time. He denies any fevers. He does have a recent 25 lb weight gain and he admits to new nocturia of 2-3 times a night over the last three weeks. He also has been complaining of diarrhea two or three times a week over the last two to three weeks, which is watery in nature without any blood. He has no nausea or vomiting or any fever, and he has never had problems with diarrhea like this in the past. His past medical history is otherwise benign. Habits: He does have a history of cocaine abuse, and while he was free basing about one year ago, he came into the emergency room with chest pain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart from the cocaine, since which time he has been using cocaine much less frequently. He denies any tobacco use, and he drinks alcohol socially. He is currently unemployed and lives with his mother. He is sexually active with one sexual partner and denies any other risk factors. Family History: His family history is notable for a grandmother with diabetes and hypertension, mother with heart disease and father with history of breast CA, who is currently getting radiation therapy here. His oldest brother died of street violence and his younger brother is alive and well without any medical problems. Physical Examination; He is a mildly obese black male in no acute distress with weight of 270 lbs. Blood pressure 138\/88 in the right arm and 132\/94 in the left arm. Pulse regular at about 80. HEENT was notable for normal fundi without any evidence of diabetic retinopathy or hypertensive retinopathy. Oropharynx was clear. He had no thyromegaly. His chest was clear. His breasts showed no masses or discharge, and his 1-29-62 heart sounds were normal. His abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, without any hepatosplenomegaly. Genitalia: normal, with bilaterally descended testes, and his rectal exam was normal tone with brown trace heme positive stool. Neurologic exam was intact. Assessment and Plan: 1. Non-insulin dependent diabetes with possible symptoms of increased sugar at this time. Will check a fasting blood sugar tomorrow morning as well as a hemoglobin A1C, and may increase his Diabeta to 10 mg. q.d. He will be referred to a nutritionist for diet control as well. 2. Hypertension: borderline hypertension at this time off meds. I will recheck his blood pressure in a week to two weeks, and if it is still borderline at that time, will follow only with a low-salt diet. 3. Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea. I will get a stool culture and O&P since the diarrhea is persistent for two to three weeks, and follow it at this time. 4. Patient requesting HIV test: and HIV counseling was given at this point, and a test will be drawn, and I will give him the result when it is back, though I feel that he is very low risk at this time.

The patient's current medical problems include: 1. Recent DVT. The patient was admitted between the days of 1-24 and 1-30 secondary to the development of a right lower extremity DVT. The patient told me that he had been doing well and denied any previous trauma to his leg or other predisposing factors such as long car or airplane trips and he stated he had been as active as previously over the recent few weeks. The patient stated he awoke in the morning of the 24th and noted tightness in his right quadriceps and right calf. He later developed progressive swelling of the leg and therefore presented to the THD emergency department. He had lower extremity non-invasives performed which confirmed the presence of a right lower extremity DVT. He was admitted and heparinized and then Coumadinized prior to discharge. The patient disclosed a history that his daughter had a DVT at the time of her pregnancy and therefore a hypercoagulability work-up was sent off which was negative. The patient currently returns to me complaining of further right calf pain and swelling. He states that he was interested in physical therapy but states that that did not occur during his hospital course. The patient was also angry and upset that I had not visited him during his hospital stay. I explained to him that I had not been notified of his admission or of his emergency department visit. I called all of the parties responsible for his admission to clear the confusion that had occurred. 2. Hypertension. The patient's previously been on anti-hypertensives including lisinopril, unfortunately the patient has not tolerated ACE inhibitors secondary to a severe cough and therefore these were discontinued recently. With a discontinuation of his drinking, the patient's blood pressures have been under much better control. 3. Adult onset diabetes mellitus. I recently started the patient on insulin. He was scheduled for a follow up visit but unfortunately did not make his visit. His insulin dose was adjusted during his recent hospitalization and his current dosage is 35 units of NPH in the morning and 15 units of regular. In the evening he takes 10 units of NPH and 10 units of regular. The patient does not yet have a home glucometer. We will arrange for this. THD INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES Hart, Matthew Page 2 46103196 2-4-65 Physical Examination: Vital signs showed a heart rate of 90. Blood pressure: 135\/92. Respiratory rate: 14 and unlabored. HEENT: pupils equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear. Mucous membranes moist. Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs: clear to ausculation. Abdomen soft, nontender with active bowel sounds. Extremities: There was notable edema of his right lower extremity with significant pain and a positive Homan's sign. Impression: 1) DVT. Given his current physical examination, and lack of recent PT check since time of discharge on the 30th, I am sending a stat PT. I encouraged the patient to elevate the leg. My feeling is that the DVT has not successfully been treated and that likely his PT is not therapeutic at the present time. I have arranged for the patient to follow up with Aguilar, the Internal Medicine nurse, on Wednesday for a repeat check of his PT. I left instructions that I should be called immediately upon receiving the PT value, I also arranged for the patient to meet with the physical therapist for the provision of a cane to help with ambulation. 2) Adult onset diabetes. I will recheck a hemoglobin A1C value at his next office visit. A finger stick in the office approximately three hours after eating is 253. I feel this is still too elevated. I will therefore adjust his insulin dose when I see him next week. I will follow up with the patient next week and make any necessary adjustments in his medications at that time.

CURRENT ISSUES: 1. Adult onset diabetes mellitus. The patient had a hemoglobin A1C approximately a month and a half ago, which was 9.5. We discussed this in the office today, with the general concept that someone who is taking three injections of insulin a day should have much tighter control. He states he has been following his finger sticks, though admits that occasionally forgets to do this. His current regimen is 35 units of NPH in the morning with 20 units of regular. At bedtime, he is taking 35 units of NPH and 6 units of regular at dinnertime. He denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia. 2. Hypercholesterolemia. Of note, the patient recently experienced a rash to his simvastatin. This resolved on the discontinuation of the simvastatin. Of note, his most recent cholesterol was 314 in January, 2067. He has met with the dietician to discuss the institution of a low-fat diet, and states that he tries to avoid fats. 3. Venous insufficiency secondary to deep venous thrombosis. The patient states he is doing better since the institution of a Jobst stocking. He still notes significant edema when he doesn't wear this, but notes an improvement in ambulation when he is compliant with the stocking. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure: 130\/90. Heart rate: 76. Respiratory rate: 12 and unlabored. Cardiac exam: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, obese, with active bowel sounds. Extremities show no clubbing or cyanosis. There is 1+ pedal edema of the right lower extremity, which is covered with a Jobst stocking. Foot care remains excellent. IMPRESSION: 1. Adult onset diabetes mellitus. We will increase the patient's morning NPH dose to 40 units. He will once again try to become more compliant with his diet. He will be scheduled for a follow up ophthalmologic examination. 2. Hypercholesterolemia. We will hold off re-starting therapy given his recent rash to simvastin. We will re-check a fasting lipid profile as well as a set of LFT's.

For his pre-operative work-up, the patient had a stress PET exam on 3\/26 that was notable for a medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible. As a result, the patient was referred to Dr. Carroll who saw the patient in clinic on 3\/27. Given the patient's risk factors and positive stress test, the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy. On the evening prior to his catheterization, he had dialysis. The patient went to the cath lab where he was found to have an 80% lesion of the mid-RCA so a bare-metal stent was placed. After cath, the patient was started on ASA 325mg PO daily and Plavix loaded with 600mg PO x 1 then 75mg PO daily thereafter. He was also given Warfarin 8mg PO x 1 for an INR of 1.6.Review of Systems negative except as abovePast Medical History 1. IDDM (A1c 6.9, neuropathy) 2. Hypertension 3. Hyperlipidemia 4.

He said that his father has been\nsick, so he has been spending a significant amount of time\nhelping him and because of that had a short dialysis on Wednesday\nand missed his Friday dialysis run. Today is Sunday and he\ngenerally gets dialysis on Sunday as well. When I asked if he\nhas been having chest pain, he says he has not had chest pain,\nbut he did have a tickling in his chest that lasted seconds and\nwas not accompanying with any diaphoresis or radiation of the\npain. Even he was ambulatory into the ED, he had no chest pain\nwhen he was exerting himself. He does feel slightly increased\nshortness of breath and worse when he walks around, but he thinks\nthat because of increased fluids. He has had no fevers or\nchills, no lightheadedness, no nausea, vomiting and no diarrhea.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,\ncoronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis,\ndiabetes, DVT on Coumadin, hypertension, bladder cancer,\nsubstance abuse and GERD.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: AV fistula in 01\/2078.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco, rare alcohol and occasional cocaine\nuse.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Breast cancer and prostate cancer.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As mentioned in HPI, otherwise negative.\nMEDICATIONS: Reviewed, please see the list.\nALLERGIES: Include cephalosporin and simvastatin.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 97.3, heart rate 92,\nrespiratory rate 28, blood pressure 155\/84 and O2 saturation 100%\non room air. The patient is awake, alert, talking in complete\nsentences, appears to be mildly uncomfortable. ENT: Atraumatic.\nNeck: Normal to inspection, supple. Chest: Clear to\nauscultation bilaterally, no rales. Cardiovascular: Regular\nrate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen: Minimal\ndistention, soft. No focal tenderness. Skin is intact.\nExtremities: No lower extremity swelling or edema, no calf\ntenderness bilaterally. Neuropsychiatric: Oriented x3. Cranial\nnerves II through XII tested and intact. No motor or sensory\ndeficits. Gait is normal.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient received an EKG, which\nshowed normal sinus rhythm. No significant ST or T\nabnormalities, no significant peaked T waves are consistent with\nhis previous EKG. PA lateral chest x-ray showed no evidence of\nacute cardiopulmonary infiltrates. Only labs which resulted\ninitially were CBC, which showed a hematocrit of 33.2, platelets\n423,000 and white count of 6.74. We made contact with the renal\nfellow who recommended that we proceed dialysis while the\ndialysis unit still open and we felt that it was safe for this\npatient. His potassium was not back at the time that he left the\ndepartment, however, he was well appearing and had no arrhythmias\non the monitor and we think that his tickling chest sensation is\nvery atypical for cardiac symptom, not being, so we will reassess\nwhen he comes back and likely check a second troponin to be sure\nthat this is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome. After he\nleft the department, additional labs came back include INR of 2.1\nand a Chem-7 showing a sodium of 142, a potassium of 6.4, a\nchloride of 102, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 106, creatinine 6.18,\nglucose of 195, CK of 157, troponin of less than 0.04, calcium\n8.6, phosphorus of 5.1, and magnesium of 2.3 and promptly called\nthe renal fellow who was aware of the elevated potassium and have\nthe patient on the monitor in the Dialysis Unit and agreed to\ntreat him there acutely. Again after the dialysis, the patient\nwill return to the Emergency Department. We will reassess if\nsymptoms and see how he feels, check a second cardiac enzymes.\nIf he feels significantly improved and he continues to have no\nchest pain, we feel that his symptoms are likely atypical for\nacute coronary syndrome and we also called that this was not\nacute coronary syndrome if two troponins are not elevated and he\nwill be able to follow up and resume his regular dialysis\nschedule.\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Volume overload.\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.\nDISPOSITION: Pending.\nPlease see ED note for further ED course.

He was seen in MHC clinic prior to that. His LBH physician was Dr. Jaeger and his phone number is 872-9985. Patient was last seen one year ago due to the fact that he lost his job and his insurance with LBH and states that he has not seen a physician in the past year. His medical problems include: 1. Coronary artery disease with angioplasty in 2063. It is unclear which vessels were plastied. 2. Hypercholesterolemia treated in the past with gemfibrozil and niacin for coexistent hypertriglyceridemia. However, he has not taken any niacin or gemfibrozil for the past year as well. 3. Anxiety. 4. Condyloma last fall. Medications: 1) enteric coated aspirin 325mg q.d.; 2) lorazepam 1mg PO q.h.s. prescribed by Dr. Guadalupe Thacker at LBH. Patient also had nitroglycerin tablets at home. Patient used to use diltiazem 30mg PO t.i.d.; however, that was stopped a year ago when he lost his insurance. He does not have any history of hypertension in the past. Social history: He is currently not working. He has been unemployed for a month and a half. He used to be a social worker which did not involve any heavy lifting. He did community services managment. He lives with his mother and his sister and has never been married. Review of systems: Patient states that he has very infrequent episodes of chest pains over the last 10 years. However, he does say that his last chest pain was approximately a week and a half ago. When asked where the pain was he put his hand over this mid-epigastrium and stated that the pain was very similar to the pain he used to have prior to his angioplasty. He took two sublingual nitroglycerins and the pain was relieved within a few minutes of the second nitroglycerin tablet. At the time he was just sitting on his couch watching television. He has no history of exertional angina over the last several years. However, this complaint of chest pain at rest is very worrisome for unstable angina. He currently does not complain of any shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, palpitation, or pre-syncope. On physical examination Mr. Orta is a middle-aged black male in no apparent distress. Temperature was afebrile. Heart rate was 68 and regular. Blood pressure was 126\/92 in the right arm in a sitting position. HEENT was within normal limits. Lungs were clear bilaterally. Heart exam was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen was benign. Extremities were without edema or lesions. MHC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES Orta, Phil Page 2 55931516 8-02-73 Assessment and Plan: 1. Cardiovascular. Patient clearly has coronary artery disease given his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina. Given that he is on no current cardiac medication except for aspirin, I will decide to initiate therapy with diltiazem CD 120mg PO q.d. in an attempt to control his blood pressure and heart rate. I also encouraged him to continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future. The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control. After he has been on a stable dose for several days, we will perform an outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any evidence of ischemia at this time. If he does, we will recommend a cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be causing syms of rest angina. The case was discussed with any cardiacs that are on call. 2. Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease I sent an SMA-20 level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does have with a cholesterol of 291 and hypertriglyceridemia which he also has at a level of 336. He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in the past; however, he has not been taking it for the last year. I instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his diet and explained which food contain those products. I will also initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides. We will start him off on simvastatin 20mg PO q.d. later this week. 3. Daily anxiety. Will continue the patient's Ativan in an attempt to control his daily anxiety which he says is well controlled without Ativan. 4. History of condyloma in his genital area from last year. Patient states that he currently has several lesions which we will examine on his next visit. If he does, we will refer him to dermatology for liquid nitrogen treatment to remove the lesions. MHC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES Orta, Phil Page 3 55931516 8-02-73 5.

As you may know, he is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, former tobacco use, morbid obesity, no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease. He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr. Phillip Isaac Crosby, at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center. This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation. Mr. Rivers, as mentioned, denies any history of known coronary artery disease. He has had a prior stress test greater than 15 years ago, but none recently. He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram. He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 20 years. He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps, but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion, unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 400 pounds. He denies any heart failure symptoms, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently. Additionally, he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents. He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned, he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer.\nReview of systems is otherwise unremarkable.\nPast medical history is remarkable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity.\nMedications include Toprol-XL 125 mg p.o. daily, aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Lipitor 20 mg p.o. daily, Neurontin 400 mg p.o. daily, insulin, Aldactone 25 mg p.o. daily, Avapro 300 mg p.o. daily and minoxidil 10 mg p.o. daily.\nHe is allergic to penicillin for which he develops a rash.\nHis social history is remarkable for former tobacco use for many years, though he quit more than three years ago. He has no extensive alcohol or illicit drug use history. He lives locally with his wife and five children and as mentioned is a floor coverer in ID working at Provo. He is followed by Dr. Gilmore at the Helena Hospital for primary care.\nOn examination, he is afebrile, heart rate is 98 and regular, blood pressure 148\/78 and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute in no acute distress. He is a well-appearing gentleman in stated age with morbid obesity. His jugular venous pressure is difficult to estimate given his habitus. He is clear to auscultation bilaterally. He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2 and no murmur, rub or gallop. His abdomen is obese, nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated. His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles. He has good distal pulsations. His carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruit.\nLaboratory values are not available today.\nECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99. He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium. No evidence for LVH or prior infarction. He does have low voltage in his limb leads, consistent with his morbid obesity.\nImpression: Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant 47-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors, notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now. This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS. Most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS. However, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort. However, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease. As such, I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning. If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week. This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01\/2074. With regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130. As such, I have increased his Toprol-XL from 125 mg to 200 mg p.o. daily. This medication should be continued through all surgery. Additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. daily. Additionally, it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so. His last A1c was approximately 13 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age. I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk. With regards to his hypertension, he is on multiple agents including Toprol-XL, Aldactone, Avapro and minoxidil. Given the multitude of agents, it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism, but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication. We could consider in the future, if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary. Additionally, if he is found to have coronary artery disease, one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis. As mentioned, I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future. I will follow back with him in approximately several months' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim. He has been provided both my e-mail and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward.\nThank you.\nSincerely,\nKenneth Sweet, MD\n\n\neScription document:9-9031123 IFFocus\nCC: Gabriel Michael MD 67 COMANCHE STREET\nSHELTON, NH, 23574 Fax: Email: gmichael@KCM.ORG\nCC: Phillip Isaac Crosby M.D. Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center 725 Dan Chan Shelton, NH, 64187 Fax: Email:\n\nDD: 10\/26\/73 DT: 10\/27\/73 DV: 10\/26\/73\n\n* Record date: 2074-06-09\nReason for Visit This is a 47 year old male referred to the diabetes management service for uncontrolled diabetes by Dr. OldhamChief Complaint This patient is admitted to the hospital for gastric bypassHistory of Present Illness The patient has a 10 year history of Type 2 diabetes. He was treated with metformin and insulin. Unclear when metformin was discontinued. Currently the patient is treated with detemir 60 bid and novolog 50 ac as an outpatient. The control has been poor. The patient tests his blood sugar several times a day with results ranging from 200-300.The current diet is not well controlled. The patient has not been bothered by hypoglycemia. Diabetic complications include neuropathy with numbness in feet and nephropathy with macroalbuminuria. He had gastric bypass last night. He received Lantus 30. He was on D5W over night with glucose values over 300. He currently is on LR iv drip.

Patient reports that 2 days ago, when he clean his feet, he noticed a piece of skin detached from his right outer foot. He removed the skin and cleaned the wound with alcohol swab and dressed with bind aid. He did not note any injury to his foot, did not find any foreign object in his shoes. He does recall that 5 days ago, his daughter broke a vase but he did not step on it. The next day, he noticed right groin pain and felt a lump in the area. The right foot became warmer and more painful. He however denies any chills, fever, shaking or diaphoresis. He has been diagnosed with DM for more than 20 years, was on insulin and had constant high blood glucose (>600) most of the time before the gastric bypass surgery. He has neuropathy for more than 10 years. He had laparoscopic Roux-en-Y on 06\/08\/2074. His weight lost from 435 lbs before the Sx to 275 lbs. He is no longer on insulin.

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to let you know about your recent test results.\n\n\nThe following tests were essentially negative, normal, or unchanged from prior testing and do not require follow-up at this time.\n1) Kidney test.\n2) Cholesterol. Your cholesterol results are as follows:\nTotal Cholesterol = 129,\nHDL (the 'good' cholesterol) = 43,\nLDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) = 70,\ntriglycerides = 82.\nMy records indicate that your total cholesterol has increased since 01\/11\/2072. Given your medical history, we would like to keep your LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) below 100. Please continue to follow a heart-healthy diet.\n3) Hemoglobin A1c. This is a blood test that indicates how well you have controlled your blood sugar over the past 3 months. For patients with diabetes, we would like to keep it below 7. Your Hemoglobin A1c value was 6.5 on 04\/04\/2073. It has remained stable compared to the last value of 6.5 on 07\/12\/2072. Please continue to check your sugars regularly and take Metformin as prescribed.\n4) X-ray. No fractures were detected on the X-ray of your spine, but it did show changes consistent with osteoarthritis.\n\n\nThe following tests were abnormal or require follow-up.\n1) PSA. As we discussed during our visit, this is a blood test that measures activity in your prostate, and is one way to measure your potential risk of prostate cancer. This is not a perfect test, and its use for prostate cancer screening is controversial. My records indicate that your PSA has mildly increased since 4\/01\/72. I recommend that you follow-up with a urologist for a prostate biopsy, which we can arrange when you return for your follow-up appointment. At that time, we will again discuss the specifics of the PSA test and the risks\/benefits of different treatment\/follow-up options.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach me at my office at 191-537-1871. I will see you on 5\/16\/73 at 9:40am for our next appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\nBailey Bray, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBailey Bray, M.D.\n\n* Record date: 2074-04-02\nPatient Name: LOUIS,ROBERT [ MRN: 85588852LGH ]\nDate of Visit: 04\/02\/2074\n\n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness\n*H&P conducted with interpreter present.\n\n70M DM, HTN, CAD, CHF (CAD vs EtOH), COPD, elevated PSA, here for routine follow-up appointment.\n\n1) R>L groin\/testicular\/buttock pain x1mo.

This is scheduled for next week and Mr. Jarvis is quite anxious about it.\n\nHe began the Captopril and HCTZ (? or Maxide) and has noted good blood pressure control as checked at BH. At first he developed a considerable cough but in the last two weeks this has largely resolved. He states that the cough is productive of thick phlegm and may reflect a respiratory infection rather than the Captopril itself. His blood sugars when checked at home have averaged between the 140 to 150 range fasting. On one occasion a three hour postprandial was 170.\n\nHe has had no attacks of gout or gout like arthritis in the past six weeks and is quite pleased about this.\n\nHe has continued actively managing production and is planning a trip to Italy next month.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination today he looks well and comfortable. His blood pressure is 140\/76 right arm sitting with regular pulse of 68. His weight is 173 (stable).\n\nIMPRESSION: Doing reasonably well on the new blood pressure program. Since the cough is resolving it would seem reasonable to continue the present program.\n\nWe will look forward to seeing the results of the prostate biopsy and we will check glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin today. He will return in four months for follow up.\n\n\nOrvell Oliver, M.D.\nLabs: Hemolyzed sample shows K of 6.0. Will check re HCTZ vs Maxide.

He is working hard as a production manager, and he will have some time off this spring. He and his wife are planning a trip to Italy and Greece, and following this, they will spend mostly long weekends in New Mexico.\nHe has not had shortness of breath, orthopnea, or edema. The pains in his hips and legs have not been bothering him. When he tests his blood glucose level, he gets results that range between 170 and 120. He has not been specifically exercising, but does try to park his car at some distance from shops and stores and walk the intervening distance. He continues on 1\/2 tablet of atenolol 50 mg per day along with 1 Hyzaar tablet per day. Otherwise, the review of systems is unremarkable.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He looks cheerful and fit. Blood pressure in the right arm, sitting 140\/86 with regular pulse 64. Chest is clear to P&A. Heart sounds are very faint, but appear normal with normal rate and rhythm. Neck veins are not distended. Abdomen is nontender. Extremities have good dorsalis pedis pulses. Sensation in feet is intact to light touch and vibration.\nIMPRESSION: Very stable with regards to hypertension. He remains moderately hyperglycemic. He has an appointment to be followed by the urologist, Dr. Jose Quirk, in the next month for his elevated prostatic- specific antigen (the prostate biopsy showed intraepithelial neoplasia considered only a risk factor).\nPLAN: We will check the usual laboratory work, and we will let him know when the results are available. He should return in 6 months.\n\nOrvell Oliver, M.D.\nTest Description Result Abnormal Flag Ref. Range Ref.

This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. Xaysana on 4\/23\/96.\nMr. Jarvis's cardiac history began in 12\/95, when he was shoveling snow. At that time, he developed dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea. He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes. His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II, III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V5 and V6. An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a max of 4 mm in V3. He never developed chest pain. An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease. The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis. The LCx had mid 40% diffuse disease. The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of 90%. The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 90% stenosis with haziness. Given these findings, a 2.5 X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result. His peak CK was 305 during that admission. An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study, which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis. He was discharged home in 12\/95 in stable condition and follow-up with Dr. Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG. It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present. He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. Xaysana on 4\/23\/96.\nThe patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint. He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, pedal edema, orthopnea, PND, or syncope. He does report some bilateral thigh claudication, noting that he can walk about 0.5 miles before he has to stop secondary to leg pain. He denies any calf pain.\nPast medical history: 1. CAD 2. DM 3.

He has been intolerant to Lopid which resulted in pancreatitis. He has not lost any weight, but has begun to exercise.\nAllergic rhinitis\nHe has chronic postnasal drip and nasal congestion for which he uses Nasonex on a regular basis with some improvement. He has had no sinus pains, headache, or recent sinusitis.\nCerebrovascular accident\nThe patient has had no recent neurological symptoms or changes. He had a mild aphasia which has totally resolved. He has had no headaches or any focal symptoms.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\nThe patient continues on his ranitidine at night with improvement in his intermittent epigastric discomfort.\nSleep apnea\nThe patient had a sleep study in November 2091 due to excessive fatigue and snoring. He was noted to have sleep apnea, and CPAP was prescribed. He has not been using the CPAP since he was recently on vacation, but he plans to start in the near future. During his sleep study, he was not uncomfortable wearing the mask and hopefully, this will help.\nProstatic carcinoma\nThe patient is followed regularly by the urologist and last had a visit in January 2092 with PSA in a very good range at less than 0.2. He has no dysuria, urgency, frequency, or significant nocturia.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nCurrently, he does not complain of any pain or paresthesias in his wrists.\nCoronary artery disease\nThe patient has had no angina since his last visit. He exercises on a treadmill five times a week and can walk up to five miles in any given setting. He does not have any palpitations, chest pressure, pain, or significant dyspnea on exertion.\nDiabetes mellitus\nThe patient checks his blood sugars at home, and they have been in the 120 range, although he admits to not losing weight and on his recent trip was not exercising as regularly. He has had no symptoms with hypoglycemia.\nHypertension\nThe patient monitors his blood pressure closely at home and finds it to be at around 120\/70.

This occurred approximately one week ago in the setting of walking up the stairs and carrying a heavy package. He notes that his pulse went up to 101 and he had overall felt tired in his chest. He did not take any nitroglycerine, and his symptoms promptly resolved. He has continued to notice episodes of intermittent rapid pulses with pulses up to 100. He has had no syncope or near syncope. Generally, he has been walking on the treadmill up to four to six miles a day several times a week. Over the last few weeks, he has felt a little bit more fatigued and now can only walk approximately four miles. He has not had any sustained palpitation, syncope, or near syncope, but has noted a slight decrease in his exercise tolerance.\n\nProblem List (reviewed)\n\nCoronary artery disease MAJOR\nHypertension MAJOR\nDiabetes mellitus MAJOR\nCarpal tunnel syndrome MAJOR\nAllergic rhinitis MAJOR\nAngina pectoris MAJOR STATUS POST\nProstatic carcinoma MAJOR\nCerebrovascular accident MAJOR\nSleep apnea MAJOR\nGastroesophageal reflux disease MAJOR\nHyperlipidemia MAJOR\nColonic polyp MAJOR\n\nMajor Problems\n\n\nCoronary artery disease\nsee HPI\n\nHypertension\nThe patient monitors his blood pressure closely at home and finds it to be at around 120\/70.

Of note, the patient had a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after his CABG. However, he has not had any significant symptoms since that time. He remains active without any evidence of congestive heart failure on exam. He continues to exercise on a regular basis. Given his slightly elevated pulse rate, his atenolol will be increased to 25 mg PO BID from one per day which is what he is currently taking. His blood pressure is under good control. Given his recent episode of repeat stress test will be sent. If there is any prolonged episode of pain, he will come to the emergency room immediately. He is encouraged to use nitroglycerine sublingually if he has any evidence or any chest pressure. For his diabetes, his labs will be sent. He remains on Coumadin for anticoagulation, and his INR has been therapeutic. He will follow up in three months but sooner pending the above evaluation. If he has any increase in his symptoms, he will be admitted immediately.\n\nNote transcribed by outside service\n\nTranscription errors may be present.\n\nSigned electronically by Riddle, Rhonda on Sep 25, 2092\n\n* Record date: 2092-12-31\n\n\nINTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES\nHOLDEN DISTRICT HOSPITAL\n\nReason for visit\n\nFollowup of recent MI and multiple medical problems.\n\nHistory of present illness\n\nSince the patient's last visit, he developed a maculopapular rash and his Plavix was discontinued. Since this is the only new medication, it was presumed that Plavix was the cause of the new skin rash. He also changed his beta blocker and started Toprol XL approximately one week ago. At home, he states his pulse has been under better control, and now, is in the 60 range. He denies any palpitations, PND, orthopnea, or shortness of breath. He has had no recurrent angina and has tried this week to slowly start to walk for about 15 minutes on his treadmill at a low pace. He has not had any angina or chest pain with this walking routine. He also knows that his sugars at home had been very low at 55 and 56 in the evening. He has had weight loss and slightly diminished appetite and this may account for his low blood sugars. He is here for a followup. Of note, his Bumex dose was decreased due to an elevated BUN and creatinine. His weight has been stabled, and he feels better on the lower dose of diuretics without symptoms of congestive heart failure.\n\nMajor Problems\n\n\nCoronary artery disease\nsee HPI\n\nAtrial fibrillation\nRx with rate control, and coumadin. rate 60,s at home.

Currently, he has no symptoms of unstable angina and no evidence of congestive heart failure on exam. His blood sugars have been low, and therefore, he will hold his glyburide for now. His pulse remained somewhat elevated, and he will follow up with his cardiologist relative to the need for cardioversion for an attempt to get him back into normal sinus rhythm. His weight control has been a problem. He will slowly increase his ambulation and will check his pulse and blood pressure at home. He will follow up here in two months or sooner if needed.\n\nNote transcribed by outside service\n\nTranscription errors may be present.\n\nSigned electronically by Riddle, Rhonda on Jan 07, 2093\n\n*","completion":"yes"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2150-06-15\nBaycoast Medical Center\nEmergency Department Record\n\nPatient: ISHIDA, NATHAN MRN: 8792076 DOB: 1\/24\/2076 Sex: M\nRegistration Date\/Time: 6\/15\/2150 11:25:00 PM Provider: NICHOLAS EDGE\n\nTime Patient Seen\n0245\nChief Complaint\nconstipation\nHPI\n74M p\/w constipation.

The pt says the dizziness was worsened when he stood up to walk around; noting that it was particularly bad when he was standing and concentrating on a particular task such as shaving. The dizziness was alleviated by him lying down. He added that he began feeling dizzy during the storm last week when his drinking water was contaminated. He drank tap water until he was told it was undrinkable, then he stopped. He later developed diarrhea while not drinking any water and only having occasional Coca-cola beverages. During these 2 weeks of dizziness, Mr. Ishida notes he felt that he lost 3-4 days of his life, saying that he was either knocked out or unconscious. He came to this conclusion b\/c his medication box was still full for the previous 3 days; supporting his reflection by saying he rarely ever misses his medication. Mr. Ishida states that the room was not spinning and said that his dizziness was more like &#8220;lightheadness.&#8221; He feels that his problems began when taking Tylenol- 2 weeks ago and cannot identify any other medication that is associated with his symptoms. Mr. Ishida says he&#8217;s never experienced any dizziness before, and hoped his symptoms would subside if he just stayed in bed. Mr. Ishida also described an increased pressure in his head, saying, &#8220;it felt as if my eyes and ears were going to explode.&#8221; Pt denies head trauma\/falls, syncope, intoxication (from drugs or ETOH), or CP.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\nGeneral- No fatigue, lack of sleep, change in appetite, or weight gain\/loss\nSkin- No rashes, pruritus, bruising, or swelling\nHead- No trauma, headache or syncope\nEyes- No change in vision, blurring, diplopia, irritation, photophobia, discharge, or spots\/flashes\nEars- No change in hearing, pain, itching, buzzing, or ringing\nNose- No nasal congestion, runny nose, or epistaxis\nMouth\/Throat- No oral ulcers, pain, dry mouth, dysphagia, sore throat, or swollen glands\nNeck- No pain, discomfort\nBreast- No pain, masses, or discharge\nLungs- No cough, SOB, DOE, orthopnea, PND, or pain\nCardiac- No CP or pressure or palpitations\nAbdomen- Mild occasional constipation (resolved with laxative or stool softener).

Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated. He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca-cola over several days. This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia. Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN\/Cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process. Although BUN\/Cr ratio is not >20, we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h\/o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN\/Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure. Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs (e.g. Naproxen), an ARB and an ACEI, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF.\nIntrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides. Conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h\/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.\nLastly, Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h\/o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.\nMr. Ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF. Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc.\nPLAN\n#) Acture Renal Failure\n-Continue fluids and hydration: 1L of IV saline over the next 24 hrs\n-D\/c naproxen use.\n-Rule out Post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters. If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate. Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.\n\n#) DM\n-Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.\n#) CAD\n-Switch Atenlol to metoprolol given ARF\n#) HTN\n-Discontinue lisinopril, valsartan, furosemide until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves.\n#) Gout\n-D\/C allopurinol until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves\n#)Hypercholesterolemia\n-Continue simvastatin as previously prescribed (Simvastatin 20 MG PO QHS)\n#) Psoriasis\n-Continue Ammonium Lactate 12% Cream and Calcipotriene 0.005% TOP BID prn\n#)Benign Prostate Hypertrophy\n-Continue Finasteride and darifenacin as previously prescribed.\n\nWilliam Yates, MSIII\nPager #66612\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2067-12-09\nPatient Name: LAGNSTON, SHERMAN I.; MRN: 7223692 Dictated at: 12\/09\/67 by GARY J. HUGHES, MD\nFOLLOW UP NOTE DIAGNOSIS: Renal cell carcinoma, presumably metastatic to T1. Interval since conformal radiation therapy to vertebra T1 to a dose of 50.4 gray: Three months. TUMOR STATUS: Not available. NORMAL TISSUE STATUS: No difficulty. INTERVAL HISTORY: Mr. Lagnston is generally doing well with no deterioration and some improvement in his symptomatology. He now has occasionally tingling in his feet and hands, which is possibly similar to before or less so. He also has some posterior neck tingling, probably related to some position or activity and with lifting weight. He has no weakness in any extremities. His nocturia has decreased from three to one. His hands feel a little fuzzy. The trembles, which he has had for some time are possibly better or the same, still a little worse on the left hand than the right. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination he looks well. His weight is up to 230 pounds. He has no percussible bony tenderness throughout. His abdomen is entirely negative, so is his incision. IMPRESSION: Clinically possibly slightly improved, certainly no evidence of progression. PLAN: I will obtain a repeat chest and thoracic spine CT, as well as a bone scan. Assuming that these are not indicative of further progression, I plan to see him in routine follow up in four to six months. Dr. Levine would like some blood tests drawn on him, which I will happy to arrange when I hear exactly what they are. Dr. Sweet is still seeing him frequently and giving him Norvasc and Atenolol for his blood pressure. GARY J.

At the time of this stenting, he had total occlusion of his midRCA and mid circumflex with collaterals. He presented with recurrent CP in May, and he underwent a second cath that revealed patent LAD with stent. This admission he had a 10-15 minute episode of chest and jaw pain with tachycardia and hypertension by home monitoring. The pain resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerins. He went to Butte Ridge Associates where he was placed on heparin. In the setting of heparin bolus with PPT >150, he had one episode, moderate volume of painless rectal bleeding. Since transfer, still on heparin, he had no further bleeding, nor guiac positive stool until today. This morning he passed a large brown bowel movement which was guiac negative. Following this, after returning to bed, he had a small amount of oozing of blood from his rectum. He had no abdominal pain. No further bleeding since this morning.

There is no contraindication to cardiac catherization or continuing these important medications. There is also no intervention we could do now to adjust the risk. Would recommend proceeding to cardiac catherization.

He has diffuse disease, otherwise with good collateralization. His exercise tolerance test in May showed excellent exercise tolerance, but positive images and positive tracings for ischemia. His Duke ETT score was -10, but his perfusion images showed moderate reversibility in the inferior myocardium with fixed defect anteriorly. He had infero-apical hypokinesis with an EF of 45%. It is also noted that his blood pressure fell, but normalized during exercise. The patient has been stable until last several weeks when he has noted some lower jaw symptoms anteriorly. He has no chest squeezing, neck squeezing, or jaw pain, but there is an odd sensation under the front teeth. He correlates this with exercise, but not consistently. He also occasionally feels this at rest. He is able to walk uphill and generate a pulse of 90. He is working doing heavy labor in the garden, moving, and digging. It is not clear that this represents angina, but we will let Dr. Null know. He is seeing Dr. Null in three to four weeks. 01\/13\/2072:. The patient has been improving steadily since his last admission for CABG in November 2070. He states his exercise tolerance is steadily improving and he is able to walk 2 miles at a rate of 17 minutes per mile without dyspnea or fatigue. He has no chest pain or palpitations. He does worry about bradycardia and states his metoprolol of 50 mg BID may be too much. He has been withholding half to full dose in the evenings when he finds his pulses about 50. He has no symptoms of forgetfulness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness. He does have cold extremities. There is no weight gain, weight loss, or orthopnea. He remains on beta blocker, lipitor, Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, and warfarin. He is no longer on Plavix. He has no nitrate. On exam, he is somewhat hypertensive, but lungs are good and there is no elevated JVP. His EKG shows first-degree AV block and I have asked him to bring that to Dr. Null's office today.\nA: Stable.\nP: Continue medicines as they are because of borderline blood pressure today. We would not escalate\n\nElevated blood pressure\nThe patient is on Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. He states his blood pressure at home is usually quite good and he feels it is responsive to external stressors. I have asked him to think hard about removing those stressors from his life in order to maintain health.\n\nHyperlipidemia\nThe patient remains on 40 mg of lipitor. It has been a year since we have checked his excellent results and we will check today. He has been fasting for 12 hours.\n\nIron deficiency anemia\nWe will recheck his indices today. He is not fatigued or pale.\n\nRenal carcinoma\nThe patient had repeat MRI and CT in January at the Healthwin Hospital. These were read as stable and he needs no intervention other than continued monitoring at six-month intervals. He is quite reassured by this.\n\nSeborrheic keratosis\nThe patient is ready for evaluation by Dermatology.

Contributors may be Cyclosporine toxicity and intermittent dehydration. However, the recent more rapid rise makes biphosphonate toxicity or HCV-associated renal disease a worthy consideration. Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia.\n\nI took the liberty to order a 24-hour urine collection, a kidney US, as well as SPEP, UPEP, cryoglobulin level, Fe-studies. Norvasc 5mg PO qd was also returned to his regiment. For now, I suggest to hold further infusions of Parmidronate until more data is available.\n\nBobbie will have a blood pressure check in 2 weeks (when he is in Nappanee for another appointment), and I will see him in four weeks.

Over the past six weeks he had reported a slow decline in respiratory function prompting a recent admission here 1\/23 -25\/77 for elective bronchoscopy to rule out rejection. He noted a slight spontaneous improvement a few days before that admission. Bronchoscopy showed no rejection but washings did grow M. catarrhalis -levaquin was begun on 1\/25\/77. Pt reports continued slow improvement in dyspnea following discharge. Yesterday morning he developed watery diarrhea (no blood or mucus) soon followed by nausea and vomiting (no blood or coffee grounds). He went to BOGC and describes feeling increased dyspnea. Found to be febrile to 101F and hypoxic (SpO2 94%, PaO2 53) and started on supplemental oxygen. GI symptoms have since improved and pt is tolerating PO. Denies chest pain, palpitations, cough, rash, HA, rhinorrhea, sore throat at any point during this illness.

He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG, exercise tolerance test, and Myoview study. Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC s in recovery. The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue. On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal. Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%. A subsequent exercise echo was normal. Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160\/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180. His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148\/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August. Hemoglobin A1C in 2147 was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet. He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October 2148 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.\nMr. Eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening. These episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout. The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout. His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission. He was awakened near 3 am by 8\/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw. Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes. The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home.\nReview of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months. The patient denies recent or past history of edema, GERD, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats.\nIn the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2L O2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved. EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. Subsequent EKG s revealed continued PVC s and PAC s with biphasic T-waves in V4-5. A chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum. CT scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection. Cardiac enzymes x 2 sets were negative, but D-dimer was elevated at 816. Stool sample was guiac positive, although CBC was stable with HCT 44.6.\n\nPMH:\nHypertension, treated with atenolol Diabetes mellitus type II, managed with diet Gout, treated with colchicine and indomethacin Basal cell carcinoma on right ear, s\/p excision in Oct 2148 Recurrent sinusitis\nPSH: Basal cell carcinoma excision, Oct 2148 Nasal septum repair\nMeds (on admission): Atenolol (dose unknown) Colchicine 5 mg qday Indomethacin 50 mg prn gout exacerbation\nAllergies: Allopurinol hives Hay fever\nFH: Patient has relatively poor recollection of his family history.

The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, GERD\/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal\/chest wall pain, and anxiety. The sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI, aortic dissection, or PE. The patient has elevated D-Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of DVT) or CT\/CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism. The patient s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans, which have 80 95% sensitivity. In addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur. The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin. Moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors. This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis. EKG changes lacked ST segment elevation, although T-wave inversions were present in some leads. The patient s cardiac enzymes were negative from the ED x 2 sets with a third troponin negative on the floor. The patient may have either a non-ST elevation MI or unstable angina. The plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and EKG changes, with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow. Cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan.\nPlan:\n1.

In brief, the pt is a 67M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at 3am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms. He did feel slightly SOB but there was no N, V, diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time. The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin. Upon further questioning, he thinks he had two similar episodes last week. He has not had any DOE, PND, or LE edema. He does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in Feb 2147 when he had a cardiac evaluation at the Pennsylvania Hospital. He does not know the details of the workup. Of note the pt does not smoke, is not on ASA, and has several family members with CAD but no men <55 or women<65. He is on atenolol but unsure of the dose. In the ED, he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro. HR was 85 and BP 135\/82. He was given ASA and a BB. Initially, his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V4-6. Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free, showed flipped Ts in V4-6. There were no old EKGs available for comparison. He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + (Hct 44). A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE. (the ddimer was elevated). His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation. On exam, he was in NAD and was CP free. Heart was RRR, lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema. ASA and BB were cont. The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test. However, the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead. This is planned for this morning. Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol.\nV. A.

On the morning of admission, patient developed more severe chest pain and pressure radiating to both arms and back. Pain persisted for 2 hours, prompting the patient to present to the BBH ED for further care. In the ED, patient was treated with ASA, metoprolol, sl NTG, and chest pain resolved. EKGs showed biphasic T-waves in V4-5. CT scan was negative for aortic dissection or other acute pathology. Cardiac markers were negative. Patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine service for further management. Of note, at Pennsylvania Hospital, patient had a positive ETTMIBI showing fixed + mild reversible defect in the inferoapical region in 2\/47, followed up with normal exercise echo in 5\/47.\n\nOn first night of admission, patient developed recurrent chest pain when going to the bathroom. Because of his risk factors for disease, the decision was made to proceed directly to cardiac catheterization. In the cath lab, patient was found to have multivessel CAD with an LAD culprit. He received 3xCypher stents to the mid and distal LAD with residual flow limitation. RCA with moderate disease. LCx with distal disease.\nPatient was transferred to the SDU for further care.He was started on beta-blockers and ace-inhibition, and tolerated these medications well. He was evaluated for cardiac rehab. Of note, patient was informed of the pulmonary nodule located on CT scan and the need for follow-up CT in 3 months.\n\n\n\nPast medical history:\nCAD as above\nHTN\nHyperlipidemia\nGout\nDM type 2\nGERD\nPulmonary nodule\n\nMedications (Confirmed):\n\nASA 325 mg po qd\natenolol\nIndocin 50 mg po bid PRN gout flares\nLipitor 80mg po qd\nlisinopril\nomeprazole\nPlavix\n\nAllergies:\n\nDrug allergy Allopurinol led to hives.\n\nFamily history:\nMother died at 89, had heart disease.

She is\nreferred for either fibromyalgia or polymyalgia. The patient states she is\ncurrently 60 but was in her usual state of good health until 2065 when she\ndeveloped diffuse chest wall pain and tingling. This continued to bother her\nand she eventually was treated with steroids. I am not sure she had a\ndiagnosis of PMR or fibromyalgia. She then was switched to ibuprofen which\ndid not work particularly well. Over this time, she would have intermittent\nepisodes with nocturnal discomfort and most recently has increasing pain in\nher palms, back, neck, low back, legs, and into her arms. She was seen by\nDr. Zink at Barr Clinic, and no blood studies were obtained, but she states\nshe had 25 shots of steroids. She denies any hot or swollen joints. She\nhas had occasional arm swelling but this has resolved. Extensive ROS reveals\nno photosensitivity but she does have some oral ulcers and Raynaud's. She\nhas urgency regarding her bladder and has been evaluated but not particularly\nwell. She has continued to be concerned about that. She has had fevers or\nchills but no temperature elevation. She has intermittent abdominal pain but\nhas had a colonoscopy two years ago and was evaluated for this. She has\nmorning stiffness of about an hour and nocturnal pain through the night.\n\nFamily history is otherwise remarkable for diabetes in her father. Mother is\n85. Two sons alive and well. Two siblings alive and well except for\nhypertension and hypercholesterolemia.\n\nPast medical history is pertinent for above. She has had a partial\nhysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and fracture of her wrist. Medications\ninclude for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, the following:\nmetformin 500 b.i.d, verapamil 240 b.i.d, Avapro 150 q.d, Pravachol 20 mg\nq.d, Bumex 20 q.d, cyclobenzaprine 10 q.d, Prilosec 20 q.d, and Allegra.\nNo smoking or drinking history. No allergies. No other medical problems.\n\nSocial history is pertinent in that she lives in Elizabethtown. She works as a\nmidwife and director of Iowa Birth Clinic. Her husband is\na Broadcast Technician. They have traveled quite a bit because of this.\n\n\n\nYesenia Olive, M.D.\nRE: Gerald, Marion\nMRN: 48967301\nPage 2\n\n\nPhysical reveals a very pleasant woman in no distress. Weight 152. BP\n120\/80. She had a respiratory rate of 16. She had full range of motion of\nall of her joints with tenderness in epicondyles, greater trochanters, and\ncervical and lumbar area. Otherwise, no active synovitis or skin lesions.\nNo oral ulcerations. Good salivary pool. No lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly,\nor axillary adenopathy. Chest: clear to A&P. No carotid bruits. Vascular\nexam: normal. Cardiac exam: quiet precordium without murmur or gallop.\nAbdominal exam: nontender without hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: without\nedema.\n\nI suspect she has fibromyalgia. I do not really know the place of steroids\nin this setting. I will obtain chemistry profile including CPK, LFTs, TSH,\nCBC, ESR, as well as a urine, ANA, CRP, and RF. I will see her back in four\nto six weeks. She will get old records for me to review. We will talk about\nwhat therapeutic interventions we may take at that time, but I really need to\nhave more information because at this point her symptoms are rather benign.\nI will be in touch with her regarding these results as they come in.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\nMiguel H.

I was seeing her for various rheumatologic issues. She\ncomes in today with ongoing pain in the left side of her face.\nActually, upon exam, she clearly simply has left TMJ. She has\nbeen told this by ENT and I reinforced to her that that is what\nshe has and she will go ahead with a dental visit that she had\nplanned. However, she has other medical problems which I will\ndeal with until she sees you. At her last visit, there was a\nquestion of PMR and she had 25 shots of steroids but I have not\ngiven her steroids and she has done reasonably well. However,\nshe does have a history of a recent mild anemia but has diabetes,\nhypertension and hypercholesterolemia and medications include\nmetformin, verapamil 250 b.i.d, Avapro 150 q.d, Pravachol 20\nq.d, Bumex, Bentyl, Prilosec and Allegra.\n\nPhysical examination today reveals left TMJ pain which reproduces\nher pain. She had had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. HEENT\nwas otherwise unremarkable. I obtained blood studies which\nrevealed a blood sugar of 208, abnormal LFTs with an AST of 62\nand ALT of 58, normal ferritin B12 and folic acid, TSH of 8.8\nwith thyroid antibodies pending, urine microalbumin\/creatinine of\n14.5 and a CBC which had anemia with a hematocrit of 32.9. A1c\npending. A protein electrophoresis is pending and urinalysis did\nnot reveal proteinuria or sediment. HBsAG and HCV are pending as\nwell.\n\nI will be in touch with her regarding these results.

The following issues addressed:\n1. Diabetes: She is currently feeling well and denies any\nsymptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. Maintained on Glucophage\n1000 mg b.i.d. Blood sugar testing at home once or twice a day\nis around 120. We will be obtaining glycohemoglobin level today.\nHas ophthalmological exam scheduled.\n2. Elevated cholesterol: With her diabetes, her target LDL will\nbe less than a 100. She is maintained on Pravachol 40 mg a day\nand LDL from 09\/15\/83 was 154 with a total cholesterol of 256.\nWe will initiate Zetia to add to the Pravachol.\n3. Hypothyroidism: Maintained on Levoxyl and TSH level is\nacceptable at 3.93 with a T4 of 8.5.\n4. Hypertension: Maintained on Avapro and verapamil and blood\npressure is currently acceptable.\n5. Question of rheumatological disease, elevated sedimentation\nrate, diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica has been considered in\nthe past. No new symptoms of muscle aches, but now report a\nhistory of recent chest pain.\n6. Exercise-induced chest pain. The patient has noted over the\npast month that she gets a pressure sensation in her mid chest\nwhen she is walking after about 20 minutes of exertion. This\nsubsides when she stops and rests for a while. This has been\nreproduced for the last three times she has taken a walk with her\nhusband. Review of records from Dr. Olive show that she had\nthallium stress test 12\/26\/79 achieving 85% of maximum predicted\nheart rate with a workload of 10.1 minutes. EKG showed 1 mm ST\ndepression in leads II and V4 through 6. The thallium scan\nshowed slight apical ischemia and mild ischemia in the anterior\nwalls suggesting minimal ischemia in the left anterior descending\nartery distribution. She does not recall having symptoms at that\ntime. Denies palpitations, sweats or shortness of breath with\nchest discomfort. There are some radiation into both shoulders\nand neck. Multiple cardiac risk factors include elevated lipids,\ndiabetes, hypertension and postmenopausal.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Levoxyl 50 mcg q.d, Pravachol 40 mg h.s,\nPrilosec 20 mg q.d, Flexeril 10 mg q.d, Bumex 2 mg q.d, Avapro\n150 mg q.d, Verapamil of 240 mg b.i.d. and Glucophage 500 mg two\ntabs b.i.d.\n\nDRUG ALLERGIES: None.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: director\/midwife for Iowa Clinic in Temescal Valley.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Denies abdominal pain, change in bowel\nhabits, fevers, sweats chills, weight loss; otherwise, as above.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She appears in no distress. Temperature\nof 97.8 degrees, BP 130\/70 and pulse is 70. Pupils are equal,\nround and reactive. Conjunctivae clear. Sclerae anicteric.\nOropharynx benign. Neck is supple. No neck vein distention.\nThyroid is not palpable. Chest is clear to percussion and\nauscultation. Heart: Regular rhythm, S1, S2 and no murmur, rub,\nthrill or gallop. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, active bowel sounds\nand no organomegaly. Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis or\nedema. Neurophysiologic: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm. No\nabnormal complex.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n1. Diabetes. We will check her glycohemoglobin and assure she\nhas had an ophthalmologic follow up. Maintain Glucophage.\n2. Elevated cholesterol. Add Zetia 10 mg q.d.\n3. Chest pain. Symptoms certainly suggest ischemia. I have\ncontacted Dr. Ng in Cardiology and he is arranging for an\nETT MIBI and a cardiology consult. I prescribed nitroglycerin\n1\/150 to use sublingual q.5minutes. x 3 for chest\ndiscomfort and she will limit exercise until ETT is accomplished.\nSuspect she might need catheterization and hesitant to add\nbeta-blocker because of high-dose verapamil and risk of inducing\nheart block.\n4. Hypothyroidism: Adequate replacement dose on current\nLevoxyl. The patient will see me back in four weeks' time and\ncardiac workup to be arranged for early next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE Xochil Higgins, M.D.\n\n\nDictated By: E Xochil Higgins\n\n\neScription document:8-7850722 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 10\/02\/83\nDT: 10\/02\/83\nDV: 10\/02\/83\n\n* Record date: 2083-11-01\n\nWestwing Place Nursing Home\n144 Chablis Court GERALD, MARION\nDoha, KY 63216 48967301\n(638) 074-1457 11\/01\/83\n(449) 515-0294\n\nREASON FOR VISIT: Follow up coronary disease and diabetes.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\n1. The patient underwent an angioplasty on 10\/07\/83 and comes in\ntoday having just had a stress test. Stress test showed that she\nwas able to do a standard Bruce protocol for 7 minutes 34 seconds\nachieving maximal heart rate of 116, peak blood pressure 122\/60,\nstopped for fatigue. Immediately after exercise, she did have\nsome substernal chest pain, resolved 3 minutes into recovery.\nThere were no EKG changes. The patient reports that she has been\nwalking and has resumed her normal pre-hospitalization exercise\nlevel and does not have any chest discomfort with walk, which had\nprecipitated the hospitalization initially. She is looking into\ncardiac rehab program but is not sure that she needs to do this.\nShe feels very comfortable with her current exercise regimen.\nShe has been careful with her eating and feels she is living a\nhealthy lifestyle. She has returned to work. She has follow up\nscheduled with Dr. Schaefer in two days' time.\n2. Diabetes: At last visit, I had added glyburide 5 mg to her\nGlucophage 2000 mg a day. She monitors blood sugars but only in\nthe morning. Evening blood sugars are mostly in 90s to low 100s.\nHowever, at times during the day, she feels hypoglycemically\nsweating and abdominal discomfort. She has never actually\nchecked her blood sugar during these episodes as they tend to\noccur at work. She has not had any fainting or dizziness.\n3. Elevated cholesterol, is tolerating Zetia.\n4. Hypertension. At last visit, we decreased her Avapro dose\nbecause her blood pressure was quite low at 100\/64, and\ncurrently, she feels somewhat less fatigued.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 5 mg q.d, Plavix 75 mg q.d,\natenolol 50 mg q.d, Zetia 10 mg q.d, levoxyl 50 mcg q.d,\nPrilosec 20 mg q.d, Flexeril 10 mg q.d, Bumex 2 mg q.d,\nPravachol 20 mg two tablets q.h.s, Avapro 75 mg q.d, Glucophage\n500 mg two tablets b.i.d, and enteric-coated aspirin.\n\nDRUG ALLERGIES: None.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness\nof breath, abdominal pain, or joint pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She appears in excellent health and in\ngood spirits. Weight is 145, blood pressure 120\/68, and pulse is\n70 and regular. Conjunctivae are clear. Sclerae are anicteric.\nNeck is supple. No neck vein distention. Chest is clear to\npercussion and auscultation. Heart: Regular rhythm. S1 and S2.\nNo murmur, rub, thrill, or gallop. Extremities are without\nclubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n1. Coronary disease, doing well, status post recent angioplasty\nwith stenting. Maintaining current medications of Dr. Schaefer.\nAt this point, I am not sure that she actually does need cardiac\nrehab, and we will defer that decision to him.\n2. Diabetes, seems as though her control is\nimpressive, perhaps with recent change in her diet. We will\ndiscontinue the glyburide and follow up in 4 weeks.\n3. Elevated cholesterol. We will check on lipid status in four\nweeks' time. On current medications with target of LDL less than\n100.\n4. Hypertension.

HISTORY: This is a first office visit for this 77-year-old, right-hand-dominant, founder of Bed Bath and Beyond, who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain. The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain, paresthesias, and numbness on the right worse than left hand. This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep. Also bothers him during prolonged activity. He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch, grasp, and fine motor function. Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist. He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Glucose intolerance, history of previous CVA, status post CABG, hypertension, GER. MEDICATIONS: Lopressor, Zocor, Ecotrin, Effexor, and Nexium. ALLERGIES: None. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination today, he is very pleasant, well appearing in no apparent distress. Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy. There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and very weak opponens. He has a positive Tinel's, positive Phalen's, and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist. His interossei and extensors are full. Sensation is intact throughout. EMG studies from 11\/09\/2071, performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital, significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists. IMPRESSION: The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago. At this time, we feel that Larry has indeed a significant, right worse than left, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting, he has difficulty with abductor pollicis, we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as possible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer. We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan. We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future. We filled out both history and physical, as well as a surgical consent form today in the office.

He has maintained his weight, which has been quite difficult given the social commitments that he has. He is requiring to eat out quite a bit. He has also done a large amount of traveling over the last three to four months. This caused him to be more exhausted than usual. His incarcerated hernia repair has stood up. He has some discomfort occasionally in that area, but for the most part feels that this is back to normal. He is careful with his diet as much as he can be. He had a cold over the last month or so. It slowly resolved. He is asymptomatic presently.\n\nMajor Problems\nHypertension\n\nHyperlipidemia\n\nGlucose intolerance\n\n\nChange in therapies and Renewals\nNexium 20 mg PO QD Refills:2 total of 90\nToprol XL 50 mg PO QD Refills:2 total of 90\nEffexor 75 mg PO QD Refills:2 total of 90\nEcotrin 325 mg PO QD Refills:3\nZocor 10 mg PO QD Refills:3 90\nvitamin e\nvitamin c\ncalcium supplement\nflaxseed oil\nmetformin hydrochloride 500 mg po qd QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 4\/2\/2073 take with meals\n\nProcedures\nCoronary artery bypass STATUS POST.\nHernia repair Incarcerated Hernia repair.

We discussed options including diet and exercise which I think he has been very good on. Discussed starting metformin based on recent data that this may help prevent his development of diabetes. We will begin metformin 500 mg PO QD. We will check his renal and liver function in one week and his bruising is likely due to his aspirin. We need to follow up on a renal ultrasound for cysts that were discovered during his hernia operation, and I will make these arrangements.

Since I saw him last six months ago, he has generally done well. He has not had any angina. No dyspnea, orthopnea, lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope. He has reduced his exercise to three days a week-he exercises vigorously when he does exercise, but this seems to give him a little bit more in the way of stamina.\n\nPast medical history:\nNoncontributory.\n\nCurrent Medications:\nNexium 40 mg BID\nEcotrin 325 mg qd\nToprol XL 50 mg qd\nEffexor 75 mg qam; Dir: and 37.5 mg qpm\nmetformin hydrochloride 850 mg BID\nZocor 40 mg; Dir: 4 days a week and 80 mg 3 days a week\nranitidine HCl 300 mg qhs\nflaxseed oil; Dir: Gel\nvitamin b12 1 mg qd\nvitamin c\nOmega 1 tab tid; Dir: 3 fatty acids\n\nFamily history:\nNoncontributory.\n\nSocial history:\nHe has four children and 10 grandchildren.

No change from July 2075.\n\nAssessment and plan:\nMr. Lilly is generally doing well. His blood pressure is a little higher than it usually is in the office today, and we probably should have him on ACE inhibitor with his mild diabetes. On the other hand, he is a little worked up over his wife's injury, and we will monitor his pressure. For now, we will sit tight. He will have a full battery of chemistries tomorrow-he sees Dr. Mccullough, so far so good with respect to his cardiac sinus.\n\nPlan: Monitor blood pressure.

Plavix was reloaded for 1 week in this setting. She was discharged to a rehab facility in pauls valley 8\/10\/96 for PT\/OT. At the rehab facility she developed hematemesis and was admitted to the medicine service last night for UGIB. She denies CP\/SOB\/N at present. She does not have memory of the hematemesis episodes overnight. She required some reorientation to the situation leading to her readmission.\nPast medical history: 1. CAD: -s\/p PCI of PDA 2089 for 99% lesion in setting of ACS, s\/p PCI of 99% LAD lesion in 2090 also in setting of ACS, residual LV function normal w\/o focal WMA in 2091. Inferior STEMI 7\/96 due to near occlusion of PLV resulting in BMS to PLV and mid RCA. 2. HTN\/Hypertensive heart disease: rather difficult to control HTN, needing multiple agents to achieve near normal to high normal pressures. Had a good bp response to thiazides but caused unacceptable degree of hyponatremia. BP also related to the degree of chronic low back pain, and was substantially better for 6 months after localized treatment.

History of HIT AB Positive 2090\nFamily history: There is a history of non-premature cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease: Her father died of a stroke in his 80s, her mother had congestive heart failure, and a brother had an MI. Her other siblings have lived into their 80s.\nSocial history: She has not smoked, and uses alcohol only rarely. She lives at home with her youngest daughter, Vaccaro. Another daughter, Tiffany, has been also very involved in her mother's care.\nReview of systems: As above, otherwise negative in detail.\nPhysical examination: -Pulse: 58 -resp. rate: 16 -Abdomen: soft NT and ND, no hepatosplenomegaly, no pulsatile masses. -Neuro: a + oriented to self, needs orientation to location and context -Extremities: trace lower extremity edema, 1+ bilat PT pulses, 2+ radial pulses -Chest: cleart to auscultation anteriorly without crackles or wheezes -Neck: JVP not elevated, no HJR, no carotid bruits -HEENT: NC\/AT, with mild ptosis of left eyelid from post herpetic changes -General appearance: A WD, WN elderly woman in no acute distress.

Despite low level cardiac marker elevation there is little suggest an intercurrent coronary syndrome currently complicating the UGIB. Would try to continue antiplatelet therapy for a minimum of 30 days, and preferably for 90 days in the setting of recently placed bare metal stents, if tolerable from a hemodynamic and hemostatic perspective. Agree with switching to short term beta blocker, and holding lasix for now given apparent volume depletion. Continue high dose statin, ARB, and low dose CCB for BP control.\nIf UGIB continues to stabilize would prefer to maintain on H2 blocker rather than PPI to limit interference with antiplatelet therapy with plavix.\nWill follow with you.\nGeary A.

The chief complaint, history of presenting illness, past medical history, medications, allergies, social history, family history and review of systems are as noted by Dr. Russell on the record, and were reviewed with her and with the patient. PRESENTING COMPLAINT: Chills, temperature to 104 degrees. HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT: Briefly, this is a 56 year old man status post renal transplant, who was recently admitted to a hospital for rising creatinine. Tests showed that he had cyclosporine toxicity of his graft and cyclosporine was reduced. He was discharged home yesterday. This was confirmed by biopsy. He was fine overnight, but then had some chills this morning, and presented to the Emergency Department with a temperature of 104 degrees. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Is as noted by Dr. Russell on the record and basically does not identify a source of infection. The chest is clear to auscultation. The abdomen is soft with the exception of some tenderness over his graft site. The wound site was apparently inspected by the admitting team and was not found to show any evidence of infection. LABORATORY EVALUATION: Laboratory studies are still pending. Cultures were obtained of both blood and urine. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Fevers, status post renal transplant. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): Disposition - admission. Condition satisfactory. The primary physician, Dr. Oviedo, was notified.

This patient with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated on hemodialysis 2 weeks ago in MH. She has been doing well except for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for the past week. There is no history of cough, dyspnea, or chest pain. She denies any dysuria, urgency, or frequency. Her blood sugars at home have been between 120 and 180. Her current medications include Tums 5 to 6 tabs with meals, Erythropoietin, Premarin and Provera, Nephrox 150 mg tid, insulin NPH 10 units qam. On July 17, after hemodialysis, Ms. Tinsley was given a partial dose of Vancomycin and developed pruritus. CBC at the time revealed a white count of 6.2 with a hematocrit of 25.2. Blood cultures were sent. On examination today this lady appeared well with a BP of 110\/60 and a pulse of 88. She was afebrile. Head and neck examination was unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA. On cardiovascular examination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no peripheral edema. Heart sounds were normal. Urinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained 3+ protein and 2+ glucose. Miss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center. There does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection. She should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary tract infection. Because of her early satiety she has been eating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a gastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride 10 mg qid.

Her chief symptomatic complaint is severe pruritus, which has not improved much with Benadryl. She has yet to fill the prescription for Sarna lotion. Her diarrhea has improved with Imodium, and she brought in samples for cultures today. Her appetite has improved somewhat. She notes exertional fatigue and shortness of breath. Medications include Phoslo 1 tablet t.i.d, Lasix 160 mg b.i.d, Altase 2.5 mg b.i.d, Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d, NPH 10 units q.d, iron t.i.d. On examination, weight was 46.8 kilos, which is stable. Heart rate was 72, blood pressure 130\/64. JVP was clearly seen at 6 cm greater than the sternal angle, and there was 1 plus peripheral edema. There was no S3. Chest examination revealed bibasilar inspiratory crackles. Her left hand is no longer cold, but the PTFE graft remains slightly edematous. Blood work from May 30th showed a hematocrit of 23, potassium 5.2, bicarbonate 15, BUN 91, creatinine 7.9, calcium 5.5, phosphate 5.2, albumin 3.4. We will continue to hold off on dialysis until such time as Peggy's PTFE graft is suitable. This will save her the additional morbidity of a semipermanent IJ catheter. She is more hypervolemic than last week, and I added Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg in the morning to her diuretic regimen. By oversight, she was not started on Rocaltrol, and I have started her on Rocaltrol .25 mcg p.o. q.d, and Nephrocaps 1 p.o. q.d.

Stafford, M.D. Chief, Transplant Divistion Department of Surgery Family Practice Missoula Re: Peggy Tinsley FPM#: 236-67-03-3 Dear Dr. Stafford: I was asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on Mrs. Tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed as a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant. In summary, she is a 46 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic since the age of 29 and has been on hemodialysis since 2083. By report, her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease. In viewing her present history, she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department. Her three times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated. She does, however, experience occasional chest pressure with activities and on rare occasions has had nocturnal angina. These episodes are relieved by nitroglycerin. Mrs. Tinsley has also noted that with walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved by slowing down. In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present only pre-dialysis, she has been and continues to be a smoker. Her cholesterol by one report was 228 mg\/dl. I don't have fractionations and her family history is unknown. A report of an echocardiogram from April of 2083, shows mild ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency, preserved LV size and function. She had an exercise tolerance test in February of 2085. On a modified protocol, she went for less than 4 1\/2 minutes. This is equivalent to not even completing stage 1 of the standard Bruce. With that, she did develop chest pain and had 2 mm of ST depression. That study was accompanied by both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum consistent with prior non-transmural infarct with exercise induced ischemia. As was apparent to those involved, even the non-isotope portion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization. That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time, I only have the report. However, from this report, there was preserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace MR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies. Coronary angiography showed by report, diffuse involvement of proximal mid-LAD without specific focal stenosis until an 80% mid- LAD. The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal. The right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete stenosis. At that time, the recommendation was to continue medical therapy. Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with prempro 2.5 mg once a day, tenormin 25 mg qd, aspirin one every other day in addition to her supplemental vitamins, iron and twice daily insulin therapy. In rounding out her medical history, her surgical procedures have involved the hemodialysis access. She has had one pregnancy 28 years ago without complications. I also elicited a history of some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech. This was difficult to pin down, but is of some concern. On exam, her blood pressure was 150\/80 mm Hg, pulse 90 regular, her weight 95 lbs. Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left arm. There was a right carotid bruit, neck veins were not distended. Lungs were clear, PMI was displaced and sustained. There was an S4, no S3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at the apex. Abdomen was benign, femoral pulses were intact, extremities were without edema. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, diffuse STT changes. There were no pathologic Q waves. Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for transplant candidacy, I am concerned about her current cardiac status. She is a young diabetic woman, symptomatic of both shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test, has limited functional capacity. The coronary angiography reveals a presence of multi-vessel disease. Even without seeing the primary data which I hope to do in the next week, it would be unlikely that she would be an angioplasty candidate, given the poor results in diabetics. Therefore, coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery bypass surgery. Obviously, I would like to review the films first, and speak with Dr. Upson regarding augmentation of her anti-anginals. I would also like to add pravastatin at this time, starting with only 10 mg and obtain non-invasive studies of the carotids. As indicated, although the focus of this evaluation was her suitability for transplantation, the issue of controlling symptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more pressing. I look forward to working with you and the other physicians in her care. Sincerely, Quentin U. Johnson, M.D, Ph.D. Quentin U.

Mr. Wood was at work this morning and at 9 AM he started to feel weak. He describes the weakness as lack of energy and has normal muscle strength. He states he really didn't have any symptoms other than weakness, but when asked about chest pain, he notes that he had mild chest discomfort, which was analogous to catching his breath after exercise. He also describes some mild lightheadedness. He has 2 pillow orthopnea, but he denies any fever, chills, nausea, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, syncope, HA, dyspnea, chest pain, PND, diaphoresis, palpitations, or any other concerning symptoms. He notes his last BM was on Friday morning and states his stools have not been black or tarry, bright red, pencil thin, or watery. He denies any abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. He notes that rest and staying out of the heat improved his symptoms, while exertion worsened his symptoms. He has had these symptoms before in March of this year, but his symptoms today are more mild than when he presented then. At that time he had symptoms of weakness and lightheadedness especially when standing, and he was found to have a Hct of 24.9. He was guiac positive and was sent for a colonoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy, where a he was found to have erosive esophagitis and two cecal polyps. The bowel prep on the colonoscopy was poor and he was asked to follow up with a repeat colonoscopy. He was sent home on iron supplements and a PPI. Of note, his previous colonoscopies had shown tubulovillous adenomas including a 25 mm polyp that could not be fully resected and had been Before this admission he was seen by his worksite nurse who sent him to his PCP. Dr. David Napolitano at Kessel Group Home saw him and transferred him to SMI for workup of severe anemia (Hct 25.4 MCV 75), dizziness, and orthostasis.\n\nPMH:\n\n1.

His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office. His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER. He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically. Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez. Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal. Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia. He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary. His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted. He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension. Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation. His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.\n\nPlan:\n1) GI Bleed\na. Transfuse pRBCs if necessary - Consent and Type and Cross (O +)\nb.

She still has pain in the right hip and the left hip, which is likely due to osteoarthritis. She has been taking Percocet for pain control. Fortunately, she is not having problems with constipation, as she is taking a stool softener. She is taking calcitonin and Evista for her osteoporosis. In addition, she has had a history of right tibial osteomyelitis and is taking prophylactic Levaquin, without evidence of GI upset or antibiotic-associated diarrhea. She is taking Cozaar for her blood pressure control, and is also taking Neurontin for pain control. At home, she is wearing a firm brace that Dr. Younce has prescribed. In addition, she is using a walker for ambulation when outside the house and a cane when inside the house. She comes today for her appointment with her son. She arrived in a wheelchair.\nOn examination, her blood pressure today is 138\/80 with a pulse of 80 and a respiratory rate of 16. She is afebrile. Cardiac exam is a regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without murmurs. Her neck is supple, although she does have paracervical pain to palpation. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. She has pain throughout the paraspinal muscles in the thoracic and lumbosacral area. She has some pain with flexion at the hip, with limited motion at both hips. She has no evidence of lower extremity erythema or edema. Her peripheral pulses are intact. Her patellar reflexes are absent. She has good pedal pulses. She denies depression and overall is encouraged. She plans a trip to Peru soon.\nMedications are updated in LMR.\nDISPOSITION: She will follow up with me for a complete physical examination in November of this year, and she will be fasting at that time.\n\nYonathan Turk, M.D. Fort Washington Hospital\nKV:MD:9637 \/ DD:6-17-89 \/ DT:6-23-89\n\n* Record date: 2089-11-30\nMRN: 48726886\nFORT WASHINGTON HOSPITAL\nNovember 30, 2089\nRE: Francis, Lydia PAH#: 981-82-02\nEstablished patient: Sick visit.\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Shoulder pain.\nShe presents with approximately one week of acute onset of left shoulder and neck pain without trauma.

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: History of diverticulitis abscess, status post percutaneous drainage on 01\/18\/2095 with a colocutaneous fistula; hypertension; fibromyalgia; gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal motility disorder; history of right tibial osteomyelitis in 2086; history of osteoarthritis, status post right and left total hip arthroplasty in 2088 and 2089; varicose veins with a history of chronic venous insufficiency ulcers in the past; status post esophageal dilatation, 12\/2093; atypical chest pain. PROCEDURES: Surgical consultation with Dr. Yonathan Orth; interventional radiation radiology consultation; adenosine sestamibi stress test; pulmonary embolus CT of the chest; abdominal CT scan. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 80-year-old woman who is a Broadcasting and Performing Arts Manager who had been in the McDonough County Nursing Home until the day of admission when she woke up with right-sided and epigastric chest discomfort associated with shortness of breath that was associated with a feeling of warmth rising from her upper abdomen up to her face. She described no radiation discomfort to her left arm, no diaphoresis. She has had these episodes in the past. She was noted to be hypertensive at the McDonough County Nursing Home, up to 200\/130, and was given metoprolol 50 mg and multiple sublingual nitroglycerins. She was sent to Pan American Hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency room, she received 3 nitroglycerins, Tylenol and morphine which helped relieved her pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for the above, plus ischemic colitis. In addition, she is debilitated and has lost a significant amount of weight, approximately 40 to 50 pounds since January. She also has asymptomatic gallstones. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 325 mg daily, Epogen 400 units subcu 3 times a week, mirtazapine 15 mg at bedtime, megestrol acetate 200 mg daily until 07\/15\/2095, Colace 100 mg b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation, zinc 1 p.o. daily, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d, methadone 5 mg b.i.d, isosorbide 20 mg t.i.d, ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o, lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily, lactulose p.r.n. constipation, Dulcolax p.r.n. constipation, oxycodone 5 mg q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain. ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She weighed 88.7 pounds, pulse 68 and regular, respiratory rate 20 and unlabored, room-air oxygen saturation was 97%, blood pressure was 160\/90. General appearance: Cachectic, elderly woman who was in no acute distress. HEENT: Mucous membranes were dry, pinpoint pupils that were minimally reactive, extraocular motions were intact, oropharynx without erythema. JVP 4 cm supine. There was no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, S1-S2. There is a 2\/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border. Chest: Clear to auscultation. Abdomen: There was an IR drain in place in the left lower quadrant without external drainage. The abdomen was soft with mild tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant without rebound or guarding; bowel sounds are present throughout. Extremities reveal no edema. There were chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally and ecchymosis on the left side of her foot. Pulses were 2+ and symmetric. Neurological exam: The patient has significant weakness of the bilateral lower and upper extremities with -4\/5 strength of the hands and 2+ strength in the hip flexors, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, calf, and anterior tibialis. LABORATORY DATA: On admission, white count 7700, hematocrit 30.3, platelets 443,000. INR 1.4, potassium 4.0, creatinine 0.8, CPK and troponin were negative x3. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without changes of ischemia. Chest x-ray revealed no congestive heart failure or pneumonia. Her adenosine sestamibi stress test revealed no evidence of EKG or reversible perfusion defects. She did have evidence of a fixed defect in the inferior heart with hypokinesis, with an LVEF of 75%. CT of chest with a PE protocol did not reveal any thrombus. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yonathan Orth of general surgery. The patient had expressed an interest in considering colectomy after initially refusing colectomy since January 2095. Initially, this was due to concerns about possible transfusion needs during surgery. After extensive conversations with Dr. Orth and with her family, and with the patient, I believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and perioperative healing, far outweigh any potential benefits that she may have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not to pursue this. Chest pain: The patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers. Adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects. She will continue to be treated with antihypertensives. Her chest wall pain is likely due to esophageal spasm. Gastrointestinal: Her esophageal spasms and GERD will be treated with PPI. Chronic pain syndrome: She has chronic pain from osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia. This has led to debilitating weakness in upper or lower extremities and reliance upon chronic pain medications. At the time, we will continue pain medications for her comfort. Continue aggressive bowel regimen. Feeding: The patient needs a soft mechanical diet in order to allow her to eat and masticate as she has no dentures at present. The family currently working to try to obtain dentures for her. Resuscitation status: Per the patient's wishes, after extensive conversation with family and patient, she does not desire heroic intervention and is DO NOT RESUSCITATE AND DO NOT INTUBATE. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, Tylenol 650 mg p.o. p.r.n, vitamin C 500 mg p.o. daily, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d, Epogen 4000 units 3 times a week, ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. daily, isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg p.o. t.i.d, lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily, milk of magnesia daily p.r.n. constipation, megestrol acetate suspension 200 mg p.o. daily to terminate on 07\/15\/2095, metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d, mirtazapine 15 mg p.o. at bedtime, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, oxycodone p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, Zocor 20 mg p.o. daily, zinc sulfate 220 mg p.o. daily, methadone 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.

The patient's eye pain began on 2 days prior to admission and has progressed to a severe stabbing pain that precipitated a visit to the MARY ED. The patient notes that her vision is more cloudy that usual although she does not see well out of that eye at baseline. No right eye symptoms. The patient also developed nausea and abdominal tenderness this AM. The pain was mild. She describes the pain as centered in her epigastrium. She does not report chest pain or pressure and reports no symptoms of radiation to her shoulder or jaw. She notes that the nausea is not associated with exercise or relieved by rest. The discomfort has been constant since it began this am. She denies hematemasis, fevers, chills, diarrhea. The patient denies ever having chest pain or shortness of breath with exertion.\n\nIN the ED the patient was found to have a markedly elevated Intraocular pressure of 54. She was treated with steroid, alpha blocker, Beta blocker drops and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (both PO and drops) to lower her pressure. The patient was thought to have acute closed angle glaucoma caused by proliferative diabetic retinopathy.\n\nPast Medical History:\nDiabetes: HemA1C 10.3 in Feb 2085.

Glaucoma.\n\nLikely secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy. As recommended by the ophthalmologic consultant, I will give the following meds\n-Xalatan qHS\n-Pred Forte QID\n-Timolol BID\n-Trusopt BID\n-Acetazolamide BID\n-Alphagan\nIOP will be monitored closely. If it does not trend down, the patient may need surgery in the AM.\n\n2. Nausea and Vomiting\n\nThe differential diagnosis is broad and includes symptoms related to glaucoma, atypical angina, symptoms from an SBO given her history, chemical pancreatitis and viral gastroenteritis. Of these, I believe that symptoms from glaucoma or gastroenteritis is most likely.\n- I ordered a KUB on the floor which showed normal bowel gas per unofficial rads read.\n- I think angina is unlikely given her history. However, I believe that she needs a stress test given her severe diabetes. I will be unable to arrange one for tomorrow (weekend day), but I believe she needs one as an out patient study in the near future. I will give ASA, B blocker and ACE. I will not give heparin given that her TIMI score is only 1.\n- Chemical pancreatitis is possible although her exam is so bengin. I will therefore give pt full liqs tonight and follow her for pancreatitis symptoms.\n\n3. Chronic Renal Failure\n\nThis is likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy. Pt is at baseline creatinine\n\n4. Anemia\n\nPt is at baseline creatinine. She was found to have sickle cell trait. Iron studies, B12, folate WNL. Hct stable\n\n5. Diabetes\n\nWill continue NPH and Regular insulin and cover with SSI.\n\n6. Prophylaxis\n\nOn nexium.

Though you know her history well, I will\nrecount it for the purposes of record keeping. Ms. Yerger is\npresently 81 years old. Her vascular risk factors include\ndiabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia. She had no prior diagnosis\nof coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash\npulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST\nelevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography at the\nTitonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,\nthrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent\ncomplete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal\nas well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV. Angiography also\nrevealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis. The patient underwent\nsubsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed\nby coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu. (SVG to\nramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD). Ms. Yerger's postoperative\ncourse was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient\nepisode of atrial fibrillation.\n\nSince her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of\nactivity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending\nshopping trips. Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve.\nShe denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest. She has\nhad persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein\ngraft harvesting. She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA\nsymptoms or claudication.\n\nDetailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative. Ms.\nYerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on\nher upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a\npossible viral exanthem.\nYerger, Urania\nMR #583-48-90-0 -2- December 14, 2078\n\nPast medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency\n(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and\nprior right knee replacement.\n\nHer current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.\nday, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril\n5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d, atorvastatin 10 mg po q.\nday, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream.\n\nSocial History: The patient lives alone but has many family\nmembers in the area. She is currently staying with her daughter.\nAt baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but\nis limited by chronic knee pain. She denies alcohol or tobacco\nuse. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.\n\nOn physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today. She is\ncomfortable seated on the exam table. Her skin is warm and dry.\nShe has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly\non her extremities. Her blood pressure is 140\/80, her heart rate\nis in the 70's. She has no jugular venous distention. Her\ncarotids are 2+ without bruits. Her chest reveals decreased breath\nsounds at the left base. There are no crackles or wheezes.\nCardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and\nrhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased.\nThere was a grade II\/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the\napex. Her abdomen is soft and nontender. Her extremities are free\nof cyanosis or clubbing. Distal pulses are 1+. She has mild edema\nof the left lower extremity.\n\nHer ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and\nintervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.\n\nOverall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after\nher non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid\nOctober. Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to\npersistent pleural effusion. We will reevaluate today with a\nrepeat chest x-ray. In the meantime, I think that we should\ncontinue her oral diuretic regimen. It is possible that her\npersistent rash is related to her Lasix. Although not certain to\nbe successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today\nin the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may\nresolve. I have made no other changes to her medical regimen. We\nwill continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for\nsecondary prevention. I look forward to seeing her again in\napproximately eight to twelve weeks. In addition, she will follow-\nup with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a\npersistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her\nsymptoms.\n\nYerger, Urania\nMR #583-48-90-0 -3- December 14, 2078\n\nIt is a pleasure being involved in Ms. Yerger's care.

At her last visit her heart failure had improved, but she still was hypertensive. We increased both her Losartan and her Toprol dosing. Today her blood pressure is substantially improved. She has generally been feeling well. She has continued to walk outside the home with her daughters, going shopping. She denies orthopnea or PND. She has had stable ankle edema.\nHer current medications are aspirin 325 mg PO q. day, Lasix 40 mg PO q. day, Glipizide 10 mg PO q. day, Losartan 100 mg PO q. day, Toprol XL 100 mg PO q. day, Simvastatin 10 mg PO q. day, Avandia, and multivitamins.\nOn physical examination, her blood pressure today is 130\/60. Her heart rate is in the high 60s. She is comfortable seated on the examination table. Her jugular venous pressure is less than 8. Her chest examination has a few coarse crackles at the bases. Cardiac examination reveals a non-displaced PMI with normal intensity S1 and S2. She has a grade II\/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex and a grade II crescendo\/decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border. She has 1 - 2+ edema of both lower extremities and they are warm to touch.\nHer ECG reveals sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals. There are nonspecific ST abnormalities.\nOverall, Ms. Yerger has improved significantly with better control of her blood pressure. She has signs of very mild volume overload on examination, with preserved perfusion. We elected to maintain her present dosing, but discussed increasing her dose to 40 mg PO q. a.m. and 20 mg PO q. p.m. should her lower extremity edema increase or her weight rise.\nUrania Yerger MR #583-48-90-0 Page 2 November 15, 2079\nI look forward to seeing her again in approximately six months.

Since increasing her Lasix dose approximately 12 months ago, she has had substantial improvement in her heart failure symptoms. She continues to admit to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain as limiting her exertion, but no longer experiences significant dyspnea. She denies orthopnea, PND, or ankle edema.\n\nHer current medications are aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d, Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.d, glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.d, losartan 100 mg p.o. q.d, Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. q.d, simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d, Avandia, and multivitamins.\n\nHer blood pressure today is 165\/70 and her heart rate is in the low 60s. She is comfortable seated on the exam table. Her jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm with prominent V waves. There are very rare crackles at the bases. Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and rhythm, normal intensity S1 and S2. P2 is increased. There is a grade 3\/6 holosystolic murmur, loudest at the apex. She has no edema of the extremities and they are warm to touch.\n\nHer ECG reveals sinus rhythm with normal axis intervals. There is nonspecific ST abnormality, unchanged from her tracing in August.\n\nIn summary, Ms. Yerger remains free of recurrent angina or heart failure symptoms. She does have evident persistent elevated right cardiac pressures on exam that may be related to her underlying pulmonary disease. In light of her systolic hypertension, we increased her Toprol to 150 mg p.o. q.d.

She had follow-up with her orthopaedist on 1\/15\/81 at which time she was noted to have an eschar with poor wound healing around the medial malleolus. She was therefore admitted yesterday for I&D of the open lesion on her ankle, as well as hardware removal. There is no operative report from the procedure. Reportedly there was non-union of the fracture, so hardware was removed. Tissue appeared fairly healthy.\n\nShe denies having any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, or particular pain in the ankle. She has been doing some weight bearing with use of a walker. She has had some mild serous drainage from the ankle, but no purulent drainage.\n\nROS: See HPI for positives. ROS otherwise negative in detail.\n\nPMH:\n1. CAD: s\/p NSTEMI in 2078, followed by CABG (SVG to ramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD)\n2.

If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound, then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics. However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware, then this represents osteomyelitis by definition, and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware.\n\nAfter discussion with the ortho resident, it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal. Thus, we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis. Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary. We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware, however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service. Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy, then monitor closely for signs of failure.\n\n1. Continue vancomycin until susceptibilities are available; will determine whether the addition of rifampin in necessary given retained hardware based on susceptibility results\n2.

The last p-CABG ETT was done in September, 2074, and did not included nuclear images. The electrocardiographic portion of both tests was considered to be uninterpretable because of inadequate elevation of the heart rate. Dr. Dotson asked her to double the atenolol dose. Since she has had low BP in the past, we increased it to only 25\/12.5. BP 80\/50-90\/60 at home and she has not felt so well, tired. Not sure whether the dyspnea on exertion that led us to get the ETT has changed since she has not challenged it.\n\nHome Blood Tests: Not very good by history. A1c over 9%.

His parents have been ill.\nReview of Systems: above Psych: Referred to urologist at KJH, Dr. Xayachack (? sp) because of absent libido. He made the switch from Celexa to Wellbutrin and added Androgel and DHEA. She has noted more acne or no more libido. The loss of libido precedes the Celexa and the possibility of its relationship to Neoral or CellCept has been raised. She sees her gynecologist regularly.\nPhysical Exam: Looks remarkably well.

BP much too high. Start Toprol 25 mg qd. I have no objection to switch to simvastatin from atorvastatin for cost reasons, but she must check with the transplant MDs re: this switch because of Neoral interaction with statins. Her chest pain does not sound particularly cardiac but will ask Dr. Dotson whether he wants any further evaluation. MUST see Dr. Aragon, see transplant MD. Make these appointments for her today.

She does not recall when her BUN\/Cr were last checked but says that it was prior to January and that results were sent to Dr. Hayes.\nNeuropathy: Not much troubled by neuropathy. She still has the sensation of food or liquid getting stuck mid sternal level. BaS last year showed GERD and dysmotility. I am not sure that Reglan would help, but have reluctance to try it in any case because of her long history of depression.\nCardiac: She thinks that she may be having dyspnea on exertion that is easier to precipitate than it had been. She has had some sternal discomfort at rest on two occasions while sitting at rest - felt bony. She says that she has been trying to ignore the possible increase in dyspnea on exertion.

At 11:30 his wife called him and his speech was slurred. He was able to say real words but they were slurred and almost unintelligible. He also had L hand tingling. The slurred speech and tingling resolved at 12:15 pm. He denies weakness, diplopia, difficulty swallowing, headache, vertigo, chest pain, palpitations.\n\nOne week ago, while he was on vacation in Chincoteague, he had a transient episode of slurred speech.

Specifically he had: CABG x 3; LIMA: Pedicle (IMA) to LAD-Mid Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-2nd Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-3rd; Coronary Endarterectomy.\n\nHe was in his USOH until several months ago when he first noticed lower extremity edema and activity intolerance. Symptoms waxed and waned, but eventually progressed so he was experiencing daily SOB and fatigue with usual daily activities such as walking or working around his home, and worsening LE edema up to his knees. He sought evaluation from his PCP 3 weeks ago was and found to have severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 25% on stress-MIBI. There was global hypokinesis. Perfusion images suggest a small distal anteroapical scar and moderately dilated LV (both new since 2076). There was no definite evidence of ischemia, although it is noted the patient was unable to achieve 85% MPHR due to poor activity tolerance.\n\nHe was started on Coreg, as well as Lasix which has been uptitrated from 20 to 60mg qd, with subsequent 12-14 lbs weight loss. His lower extremity edema is markedly improved, and activity tolerance is moderately improved. He can perform basic ADLs such as dressing and bathing without difficulty. Walking, especially inclines, climbing stairs, and carrying parcels will cause SOB. He still feels fatigued throughout the day. He has no orthopnea, PND, abdominal distension, early satiety, abdominal pain or anorexia. He reports BPs are much improved with the addition of Coreg, even as they are running 130-150s\/80-100.\n\nPast medical history:\n1. DCM, diagnosed 7\/81.\n2.

He was formerly self-employed as a CPA and would often travel worldwide. He stopped doing so after 2075 so has no recent travel out of the country. He is now employed by Applied Industrial Technologies as an accountant.\n\nHabits: Denies any history of tobacco use. Although he denied illicit drug use, his chart review revealed above noted history of cocaine abuse. He subsequently admitted to prior use, i.e. at parties while traveling. He denies related excessive ETOH use, use of other illicit drugs, or high risk sexual behaviors. He admits to 3 drinks per week currently.\n\nReview of systems:\nAs detailed in HPI.

The plan of care and\ndisposition of the patient were discussed with the resident.\nIMPRESSION: This is a 70-year-old male who presents with two\nweeks of back pain radiating from the mid back to the chest. He\nalso has pain in his left leg up to his flank. He also has some\nscrotal swelling and lower abdominal pain. The pain has been\nintermittent and the patient has been taking Vicodin for the past\ntwo days. The pain that he has been having is actually chronic,\nexcept for the left-sided flank pain and the chest pain. He was\nfound on the ground by his daughter, and it was unclear to the\npatient how he ended up in that position.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for myocardial infarction,\natrial fibrillation, diabetes, cerebrovascular accident, low back\npain, sciatica, Bell palsy, reflux, osteochondritis, peripheral\nvascular disease, and diabetic neuropathy.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is afebrile, heart rate 80,\nrespirations 16, blood pressure 126\/82, and oxygen saturation is\n100%. He is in severe distress. His lung exam is normal. His\ncardiac examination shows no abnormality. His abdomen is\ndistended, and there is tenderness to palpation in the left lower\nquadrant, and there is CVA tenderness in the left flank. There\nis also significant pain on movement of his left leg either\npassively or actively. It is not possible for us to evaluate the\nstrength in his left hip or knee because of pain. He is alert\nand oriented to person, place, time, and event. His cranial\nnerves are intact. Rectal examination shows mildly decreased\nsphincter tone, but no evidence of saddle anesthesia.\nLABORATORY STUDIES: Show a CK of 128 with MB fraction of 3.8,\nand troponin I is less than assay. INR is 2.8. UA shows 0 to 1\nwhite blood cells and 1 to 2 red blood cells. Electrocardiogram\nshows atrial fibrillation with bradycardic rate of 47. His head\nCT shows no abnormality. There is stranding around his left\nkidney. The aorta appears normal.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was given an aspirin\n325 mg p.o. and morphine 4 mg IV for pain.

I confirm that I have\ninterviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's\ndocumentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the\nevaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 73-year-old male with a\nhistory of cough and pleuritic type chest pain. The patient\ndenies any nausea or vomiting. He does have history of MI as\nwell as multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease. He\nalso reports lower extremities swelling worse than usual, and has\nleft greater than right edema at baseline due to a reconstructive\nsurgery following motor vehicle collision. Of note, the\npatient's medications include Coumadin, which he is on for atrial\nfibrillation.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is awake, alert, and in no\ndistress. His vital signs show heart rate of 70, respiratory\nrate of 24, blood pressure 112\/72, and oxygen saturation 96% on\nroom air and 98% on 2 liters. His lungs are clear and heart is\nirregularly irregular. This is somewhat limited due to body\nhabitus. The abdomen is soft and there is a chronic left upper\nquadrant tenderness. The back shows left CVA tenderness.\nLABORATORY DATA: The laboratory analysis shows a hematocrit of\n42.1 and a white blood cell count of 7.6. Cardiac biomarkers are\nnegative, and the troponin is less than 0.1. A d-dimer is less\nthan 200. The INR is 1.7. UA is pending. ECG shows an atrial\nfibrillation with some nonspecific T-wave changes in leads V3\nthrough V6.\nIMAGING STUDIES: A chest radiograph was a markedly limited due\nto patient's habitus.\nDECISION MAKING AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: There was no\nclear etiology to the patient's shortness of breath. Given his\nanticoagulation and a negative d-dimer, we feel that this is\nunlikely to be PE. It is clearly possible to be cardiac, given\nthe history of coronary artery disease and a slightly abnormal\nelectrocardiogram. This may be pneumonia, and the chest x-ray is\nnot terribly helpful. We are obtaining a CT scan of the chest\nwithout IV contrast to better delineate the pulmonary\narchitecture, and are admitting the patient to the Medicine\nService for monitoring and cycling of enzymes and ECGs.\nDIAGNOSES:\n1.

While I know that you are familiar with his history, please allow me to briefly review it for my records. He is a lovely 53 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins, status post mantle radiation in the early 70's; coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer. MIBI done at LMC 1\/24\/94 showed normal EF without perfusion defects (no scar or ischemia); he exercised 10:30 on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms. He was admitted 2\/94 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer (ASA was stopped 1 week prior to surgery; he was not on plavix preop); in PACU following resection, he had a VT\/VF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA. After extensive suction catheter use and POBA, a good angiographic result was obtained; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in. Remarkably, echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted. His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2. He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident. He was discharged 2\/11\/94, and returns today for routine follow-up.\nRegarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed. Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC, and is due for an annual visit there in the next 1-2 months.\nHe has been walking outside for the past ~2 weeks (since the weather improved), walking about 2 miles in around 30 minutes. He feels well, and has had no problems. He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion (climbing hills), but denies any unusual dyspnea. He denies chest pain, SOB at rest, orthopnea (stable 2 pillow use), PND, edema, palpitaitons, or claudication. He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics - his BP runs in the 100-120's\/60-80's, with rare systolics in the 130's. His heart rate has been in the 70-80's.\nHis past medical history includes: CAD s\/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2\/94 as above s\/p POBA VF arrest in setting of STEMI Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT LUL squamous cell cancer s\/p L upper lobectomy 2\/94 hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit) hypothyroid basal cell skin CA nephrolithiasis\nHis medications include: Lipitor 80 mg Plavix 75 mg ASA 325 mg po QD Lopressor 200 mg po BID Prilosec 20 mg\nHe has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.\nHis family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.\nHe works in consulting, and travels around the Midwest as part of his job. He is now back at work. He is married, and lives in Lincoln City. He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 \/ 17 \/ 20 \/ 24; they have no pets. He has never smoked cigarettes. He drinks 3 glasses of wine\/week, and a cup of coffee qam.\nOn physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 134\/75. He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress. His JVP is flat sitting at 90 degrees, and he has no carotid bruits. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups. His abdomen is benign. He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.\nHis EKG in clinic today is NSR at 68, with possible LAE, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III\/F, consistent with an inferior MI. He has increased voltages consistent with LVH.\nHis recent cardiac tests include: - echo 2\/94 - EF 60%, basal inferoposterior HK, normal atrai, no significant valvular disease - cath 2\/94 - right dominant system, patent LAD stent, proximal 60% LCx, proximal 90% thrombotic RCA occlusion (in-stent) with 100% ostial R-PDA thrombotic lesion s\/p Angiojet\/POBA with TIMI-3 excellent angiographic result\nIn summary, this is a 53 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA. He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint, and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this life-threatening event. Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events. Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath, he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin. Furthermore, he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix. His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records. I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 200 bid to toprol 200 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade, but otherwise, would not make any changes to his regimen at this time. We will check a full set of labs today, but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time.\nGiven his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia. Certainly, if he has any concerning symptoms, we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course. At present, however, I am delighted with how well he is doing.\nIt was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today. I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.\nRegards,\nFlorence Heather Gil, M.D, Ph.D.\nCC: Dr. Nick Golden Thoracic Surgery Wytheville South Hospital\nDr. Paul Reilly Riverside Family Practice Center\n\n* Record date: 2095-01-31\nEDVISIT^65219816^HALL, NICK^01\/31\/95^PENN, GINO\nThe patient was seen and examined in the Emergency Department on\n01\/31\/2095.

This occurred\nin 02\/2094, where the patient was taken to the Cath Lab after His\npostoperative rest. Stents were placed and the patient says he\nhas been doing well. In the meantime, he has had no chest pain\nor shortness of breath until one week prior, he was on a\ntreadmill and felt unwell with shortness of breath and chest\ndiscomfort. He stopped and felt better. Last night, he was in\nbed watching TV, he felt some chest discomfort and took\nnitroglycerin with relief of pain, and this morning he was\nwalking and walked about 100 yards, felt short of breath and\nchest pain at rest and took nitroglycerin with relieve and now\nhas no chest pain or shortness of breath at this time.

As I'm sure you recall, he is a lovely 54 year old gentleman whose history of Hodgkins disease status-post mantle radiation in the early 70's, squamous cell lung cancer status post left upper lobectomy 1\/94, and coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and perioperative VT\/VF arrest at the time of his LUL resection 1\/94. At that time, emergent catheterization revealed massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA, managed with extensive suction catheter use and POBA, with a good angiographic result. No stents were placed given the thrombus burden. Remarkably, subsequent echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted. His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2. He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident. He was discharged 2\/11\/94, and had done well until 1\/31\/2095, when he presented to WSH with unstable angina, having noted new sudden onset angina and dyspnea while making his daily walk. He had a positive troponin, and was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization, which revealed a proximal LAD lesion (felt to be the culprit) and ostial RCA lesion, both of which were stented with CYPHER stents. At that time the decision was made to increase his plavix from 75 to 150 as an attempt to maximize his medical management, given his history and disease burden.\nSince that admission, he has done exceedingly well, and presents today without complaints. He continues to walk 2 miles ~4 times\/week without exertional symptoms. He specifically denies chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema. He has had no palpitations, dizziness\/presyncope, or claudication. He has significantly modified his diet to eliminate dairy and hydrogenated products\/snacks, with a 5# weight loss, and is motivated to further reduce his weight. He states that he feels great and isdoing quite well. He does not that occasionally at this work, when he is frustrated\/upset, he will take his pressure and find his systolic to be ~150, but this comes down within minutes if he relaxes, and his pressures are great at home. He has had no GI symptoms on the aggressive antiplatelet regimen, despite not being on a PPI.\nRegarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed. His most recent imaging was 11\/94, which was negative for evidence of metastasis by repor. Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC on an annual basis.\nHis past medical history includes: CAD s\/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2\/94 as above s\/p POBA VF arrest in setting of STEMI Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT LUL squamous cell cancer s\/p L upper lobectomy 2\/94 hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit) hypothyroid basal cell skin CA nephrolithiasis\nHis medications include: Lipitor 80 mg Plavix 150 mg ASA 325 mg po QD Toprol 200 mg po BID Levoxyl Omega-3-fatty acids Multivitamin\nHe has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.\nHis family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.\nHe works in consulting, and travels around the midwest as part of his job. He also works a few days a week at the local supermarket cashiering, and works as a museum docent a few times a week. He is married, and lives in Lincoln City. He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 \/ 17 \/ 20 \/ 24; they have no pets. He has never smoked cigarettes. He drinks 1 glass of wine a night.\nOn physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 75 and a blood pressure of 129\/81, with a weight of 220#. He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress. His JVP is ~7-8 cm; he has no carotid bruits. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and a physiologically split S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups. His abdomen is benign. He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.\nHis EKG in clinic today is NSR at 75 with possible left atrial abnormality, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III\/F, consistent with an inferior MI.\nIn summary, this is a 54 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA, who represented 1 year later (1\/95) with NSTEMI now s\/p PCI to his RCA and LAD. He is now asymptomatic status post this intervention Given his history, we agree with antiplatelet therapy, with a plan for lifelong plavix and aspirin. Should he require future invasive diagnostic procedures, it would be reasonable to decrease doses to 75 plavix\/81 ASA, but we would not favor DC of either of these medications altogether. His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records. His LDL is near goal, with a low HDL that was unaffected by high-dose niaspan in the past. I share his hope that with further diet\/weight loss and exercise, these will both improve to goal.\nAs I have discussed with he and his wife, given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, including the possibility of bypass surgery in the future. We will be guided by his symptoms, and he knows to call me if he has any problems\/symptoms. It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today. I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.\nRegards, Florence Heather Gil, M.D, Ph.D.\nCC: Dr. Nick Golden Thoracic Surgery Wytheville South Hospital\nDr. Paul Reilly Riverside Family Practice Center\n\n\n* Record date: 2096-03-10\n\n\n\nHALL, NICK 65219816 03\/10\/2096\n\nYoussef Nall, M.D. Ludlow Medical Center 45 Wilder St Post, IN 86454\nDear Dr. Nall:\nIt was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care. As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors. He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT\/VF arrest. He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight. He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%. His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA. He has subsequently had a VT\/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results. He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis. In 01\/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results. Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily lifelong.\nWe see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity. Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times. He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job. He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion. He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure. He has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126\/81 to 142\/92 with an average of 135\/85. His heart rates have been in 50s-70s. He has had no side effects to his medications. He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol. He says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often.\nHis current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o. daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o. daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.\nPhysical Examination: Nick looked well. His weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153\/89 in the right arm and 150\/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular. His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour. There are no bruits. His chest is clear to auscultation. He was not clubbed. His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S1 and S2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs. He had no peripheral edema. His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly. His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.\nEKG: Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement. Prior inferior Q-wave MI.\nLab values from today: His electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal LFTs, and normal CK level. TSH was also normal. Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 6.8%.\nLipid levels: Total cholesterol 164, TG 145, HDL 33, LDL 102.\nEchocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65%. Mild left atrial enlargement, no LVH.\nImpression: Nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously. We started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks. He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week. To simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today. We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day. He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.\nWith regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child. Nevertheless, Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin. The results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening. To that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition. We have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C and S levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today.\nOtherwise, I believe Nick is doing well. We will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies. If by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital. He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.\nThis patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.\nYours sincerely,\n\n\n\nDictated by: Yisroel F Cooley, MD MPH FRCPC Email: yfcooley@wsh.org\n\nPaul Turner, MD ATTENDING\neScription document:8-4867586 HFFocus\n\n\nDD: 03\/10\/96 DT: 03\/11\/96 DV: 03\/10\/96\n\n*\n\n\n\nHALL, NICK\n65219816\n06\/14\/2097\n\n\nPrimary Care Physician:\nYoussef Nall, M.D.\nLudlow Medical Center\n10 Wilder St\nPost, IN 86454\n\nDear Dr. Nall:\n\nIt was a pleasure to see Nick again in the Internal Medicine at Wytheville South Hospital on 06\/14\/2098 for routine folow up of radiation associated ischemic heart disease.\nAs you know, Nick had mantle radiation in his youth for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and subsequently had 2 NSTEMIs in 2087 and 2090. He received bare-metal stents to his LAD and RCA and did well until 2094 when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma, his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior STEMI\/VT\/VF arrest. Immediate angiography post-resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery, with good result after thrombectomy and POBA, in addition to Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, and low dose heparin. Remarkably, after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event. He did well until 01\/2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in-stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare-metal stents. He was treated with Cypher drug-eluting stents to both lesions (3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the LAD and 3.5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA) with no residual stenosis. Because of concerns with regards to recurrent in-stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy (325mg ECASA and clopidogrel 150 mg) since that event intended as longterm therapy. He has been followed by me since 2095 with no recurrent ischemic heart disease, chest pain, and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function.\nNick continues to be very successful as a technology consultant in IBM research in Leland. As the economy is picking up, his work environment has improved as has his stress level. He is walking every day both at work and recreationally and lost another 5pounds. He takes his medications regularly and is usually compliant but ran out of atenolol last week and instead has been taking bid ramipril in its place. Every year he asks whether we can down-titrate his clopidogrel both for tolerance and cost reasons (I reassured him that it should be generic within a year). Nevertheless, we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the VerifyNow P2Y12 PRU assay, and his result was 177, which is below the cut-off of 230 PRU thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition. He recently had some transient melena for which he was placed on ranitidine.\n\nHis current medications should be aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o. daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, ramipril 10 mg p.o. daily, atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily, L-thyroxine 125 mcg p.o. daily, ranitidine 150 mg po daily, 1 tablet fish oil daily, and 1 tablet of vitamin D daily. He has no known drug allergies.\n\nPhysical Examination: Nick looks well. He is in no distress. Weight is 221 lbs. Blood pressure is 150\/80 in the right arm repeated over 3 manual measurements with a large manual cuff and his heart rate is 70 and regular. His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure, normal carotid upstroke and contour with no bruits. His chest is clear to auscultation. His cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal left apex and normal first and second heart sounds with a normal splitting of the second heart sound with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs. He had no peripheral edema. His abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly. He had 2+ pulses in the peripheral exam.\n\nEKG today demonstrated sinus rhythm at 88 bpm with voltage criteria for LVH, LAE and prior inferior Q-waves.\nWe are awaiting an updated lipid profile due this week before modifying his lipid therapy which is aimed to target a goal of less than 70 mg\/dL. He has tried and failed a trial of niacin in the past due to intolerable flushing and headache. His LDL last year was 98 mg\/dL though HDL has improved to 37 mg\/dL. His TC\/HDL ratio is 4.2, his TC is 155 mg\/dL, and TG 101 mg\/dL. HbA1c is 7.2%.\nThe previous echo in 2096 demonstrated normal LV size and function with a normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65% with no signs of LVH.\n\nImpression: Nick is doing well with CCS 1 symptoms after repeated MIs most recently in 2095 due to accelerated coronary atheroclerosis and radiation stenoses.\nTo target his coronary risk factors, I recommended the following:\n1. Should his LDL be >70mg\/dL he should switch to rosuvastatin 40mg daily for LDL and HDL improvement.\n2. Given clopidorel platelet reactivity is less than 230 PRU he will decrease to 75 mg daily and we will re-check his PRU activity after at least 7 days on this dose. Should PRU > 230 he will either need to restart 150 mg daily and take a PPI like pantoprazole or switch to prasugrel (or when available ticagrelor). 3. He will continue a healthy heart diet and exercise and we will see him again in 6 months.\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in his care. As I am not continuing a general out-patient clinic next year, Nick will transition to another cardiologist who can accomodate his day off from work which is typically on Saturday.\nThe patient was discussed in clinic with Dr. Neale Xiao who agreed with this plan.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\n\n\nDictated by: Yisroel F Cooley, MD MPH FRCPC Email: yfcooley@wsh.org\n\n\n\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2149-06-08\n*The source of this note is the RCH Emergency Dept.

Per notes, the pt was found to be unresponsive briefly after lunch, BP was checked and found to be in the 80&#8217;s systolic, EMS was activated and an IV was placed. He quickly became responsive without intervention, and BP came up to the 80s\/90s. Per notes, no reported CP, abdominal pain, HA, LH, focal neurological symptoms, SOB, palpitations. Of note, the pt was recently hospitalized at RCH 1\/23 &#8211; 2\/03\/50 during which time he had labile BP&#8217;s including HTN as well as question of orthostasis, and was discharged on Hydralazine, HCTZ, Lisinopril, and Labetalol, after having taken only Atenolol and Terazosin on admission. At rehab on 2\/05 (3days PTA), his meds were changed to Atenolol, Terazosin, HCTZ, and Lisinopril.\nIn the ED, the pt&#8217;s vitals were T 96.4, HR 63, BP 98\/53, RR 20, 95% on RA.

As patient is currently very somnolent this history is based on phone interview with Ursula Jacks who is the HCP and is very involved with his father's care. The patient was diagnosed with dementia by his PCP about 3 years ago and has been relatively stable living at home (on 2nd floor) in Keystone Heights with his wife who has been his primary caretaker; their two sons are very involved as well. Over the last 6 months they have noticed increasing confusion, agitation, and labile emotions. They noted he has been confused about location, time (recalls distant past but not recent past), and has occasionally not been able to identify his wife. He has become emotionally labile and sometimes agitated. His son notes that he recently had to physically force him to sit down and take his medications. His wife has had to stay up at night to watch the patient to make sure he did not wander. They are particularly worried about his ability to take the flight of stairs to their home since it takes him about 15 min to get up and appears unsteady. About 1 wk ago, while his wife was out of their home, he wandered out and locked himself out; when she returned he angrily accused her of locking him out. Their mother has had increasing difficulty caring for him and has called the 2 sons for help daily for the past week.

She notes that she is still having occasional sweats at night. She is using the clonidine but she can't take it two times a day, it makes her too sleepy, so she takes it about 3:30 towards the end of her workday and then again before she goes to bed. She is having some right lower back pain and otherwise is feeling well.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative except as noted. She is also taking the Cozaar which she had been taking before.\nShe was called back in today as a result of labs which were done recently which showed hemoglobin A1C of 8.7, an elevated urine microalbuminuria and hypertension which needed follow up.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam today, she is well developed and well nourished in no acute distress. Blood pressure 158\/116, pulse 80, weight 166. Pupils are equal and equally reactive to light. Lids and conjunctiva normal. Retinal fields normal. Disks sharp. Mouth and pharynx without erythema or exudate. No adenopathy or tenderness in the submandibular, cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular areas. Heart sounds: S1, S2, with a II\/VI systolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. No rub or gallop. Her chest was clear to auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes or rhonchi. She was clear to percussion. She has normal bowel sounds. Her abdomen was soft and nontender, no mass, organomegaly, and no guarding, no rebound. Her extremities are without edema, cyanosis or clubbing. She has no spine or flank tenderness. Her neck is supple, no bruits. Her skin is essentially quite dry and itchy. She has multiple dark, hyperpigmented, post-inflammatory scarring on her lower extremities. Her mouth and pharynx are without erythema or exudate.\nIMPRESSION\/PLAN: 1. Hypertension. Her blood pressure is really not well controlled. I will add atenolol to her regimen 50mg PO q.d. She drinks one cup of coffee a day and rarely has alcohol although she notes that she will occasionally have one, a scotch, on Friday or Saturday. She does not do drugs. She will return in three week for follow up of her blood pressure and at that time for a physical exam for which she will be due.\n2. Diabetes. The patient had been told in the past that she had diabetes but she was told she did not need any sort of treatment for it. Her creatinine was 0.8 last month and I explained to her that with her elevated hemoglobin at 8.7 she needs treatment. We will start her on Glucophage 500mg PO b.i.d. I expect we will need to increase this and if she tolerates this she should increase it to 1000mg over the next week. I also explained to her that if she does not eat or she is unable to eat or if she is NPO she needs to stop taking this medication. I suggested she actually take it with food to insure that she only takes when she is eating. I gave her a referral to Ophthalmology and to Podiatry. She also requested a glucometer machine and this was ordered for her along with\nCAROLYN HUNTINGTON BAILEY HEALTH CENTER 592 Kristina Street Xia, Jean North East, AL 81699 CHB9278143 (687) 396-2722 12-16-72 Page 2\nlancets, alcohol wipes and test strips and again she will return in two weeks for follow up.\nYolanda Osburn, M.D.\nCP:FO:3549 ; DD:12-16-72 ; DT:12-16-72 ; DV:12-16-72\n\n* Record date: 2076-04-23\n\nCarolyn Huntington Bailey Health Center\n592 Kristina Street XIA, JEAN\nNorth East, AL 81699 58269151\n(375) 512-0897 04\/23\/76\nSUBJECTIVE: The patient comes in today for followup of various problems.

We will check cholesterol, see how she is doing at this point, and an OT, PT to make sure she is tolerating the medication.\n3. Hypertension. All of her symptoms today are most likely due to her hypertension. I explained at great length that the reason for all of her symptoms is the fact she stopped taking her medication. She seemed surprised that it would have such an immediate and strong effect and I explained to her that it does. She has to take her medication every day. I told her she had to leave the Carolyn Huntington right now, go immediately to the drugstore to pick up the medication and she said she would do that. I also asked her to return next week so we can recheck her blood pressure and make sure it is controlled.\n4. Health maintenance. I will schedule her for a mammogram.\n5.

I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction. Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.\nFrances is a very pleasant 51-year-old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance. It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia. On 04\/09\/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest. She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting. I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery. Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention. Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.\nSince her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well. She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI. Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well. She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms.\nHer past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance.\nHer present medications include aspirin 325 mg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, metformin 500 mg a day, simvastatin 40 mg a day, nitroglycerin p.r.n, amlodipine 10 mg a day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day, and lisinopril 20 mg a day.\nShe has no known drug allergies.\nSocial History: She is married and has three children. She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care. Landis can be reached on a cell phone at 944-351-0904. She has never used tobacco.\nFamily history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke. There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family.\nReview of Systems: Cardiac: No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema. Musculoskeletal: No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy. All others are negative.\nOn physical examination, she is an overweight yet well-appearing female in no apparent distress. Her blood pressure is 131\/86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute. Her weight is 213 pounds. Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes. There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid. The carotid upstrokes are full. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. The heart is normal to palpation, no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced. The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a 2\/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium. The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds. Her extremities show no edema.\nHer EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals. She has Q waves and T-wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction.\nI do not have a recent lipid profile on file.\nOn 04\/16\/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram. She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg. She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m\/sec. There are no significant wall motion abnormalities. She has only mild mitral regurgitation.\nIn summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting. She did receive drug-eluting stents. The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction. What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.\nFrom a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time. She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint. I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point. To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia. We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.\nIn terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor. The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s.\nIn terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents. Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year. After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures. However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.\nShe is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker. The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day. This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.\nI will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.\nThank you for allowing me to participate in her care. If you have any further questions regarding her management, do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nCorrie Q Newland, MD\n\n\n\n\neScription document:3-6567539 IFFocus\n\n\nDD: 04\/19\/76 DT: 04\/20\/76 DV: 04\/19\/76\n\n* Record date: 2076-12-15\n\n\n\nPRESTON, FRANCES 05850080 12\/15\/2076\n\nLouis Barron, M.D. Shelby Dental Care Center 9842 Edwards Street Cozad, OK 53952\nDear Dr. Barron:\nI would like to give you followup on our mutual patient Frances Preston. As you know, I referred her to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of progressive worsening angina and a stress test suggesting anterior ischemia. We performed a catheterization on 12\/14\/2076. We utilized the right radial artery for access. We found that she developed a significant in-stent restenosis lesion within the previously placed Cypher drug-eluting stent. This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms. We were able to treat this lesion with balloon angioplasty and ultimately stented with a 3.5 x 24 Taxus drug-eluting stent. The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure. The final angiographic result was excellent.\nThe following morning she was doing quite well and we discharged her later in the day. She will remain on her usual medications and I have stressed the importance of remaining on aspirin once a day for the remainder of her life and Plavix for a minimum of a year after this procedure, though I will likely favor indefinite therapy.\nI plan on seeing her again on 01\/24\/2077 in followup. If you have any further questions regarding her care, please do not hesitate to contact me.\nSincerely,\n\nCorrie Q Newland, MD\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-3743412 IFFocus\n\n\nDD: 12\/15\/76 DT: 12\/15\/76 DV: 12\/15\/76\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2145-08-13\nAugust 12, 2145\n\n\nDr. Mabel Duvall\nMedicine Department\nBellflower Doctors Hospital\n\n\nRE: TUTTLE, Sandy\nMR#: 2793372\nDOB: January 16, 2082\n\n\nDear Dr. Duvall:\n\nThank you for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department. I understand that he is referred here for evaluation of polyneuropathy.\n\nMr. Tuttle is a 63-year-old right-handed diabetic man who has developed numbness of his lower extremities since 2125. The numbness started in his toes and gradually spread proximally up to the level of the knees. In 2135, the numbness started to affect his hands. In 2139, the patient noted atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous muscles of both hands, left worse than right.\n\nThe patient denies any pain in his legs or feet. He has a five year history of localized low back pain and neck pain radiating to his left upper extremity all the way down to his hands. In 2125, the patient fell down a ladder from a height of about 30 feet. According to the patient, he herniated a cervical disk, but surgery was not indicated. He remembers having pain in his left elbow and neck after the fall.\n\nThe patient developed impotence and constipation in 2130. In 2139, he started to have symptoms of orthostatic hypotension which he described as feeling light-headed, darkening of vision upon standing. The patient also noted gait imbalance in 2139 prior to his retirement in 2141.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin dependent diabetes since 2123, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, constipation, impotence, macular degeneration of the eyes, retinopathy, s\/p laser treatments, history of neck pain and low back pain as mentioned above, history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, skin problems using a number of steroid creams, penile implant in 2130.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, Diltiazem, Zestril, Mevacor, steroid creams, Colace, metoclopramide, Naprosyn, insulin.\n\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married he has two daughters, 30 and 40 years of age. He used to work as a Legal Secretary until he retired in December of 2141. The patient quit smoking in 2107. He denies any history of alcohol or drug abuse.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Father died of unclear cause at the age of 45. His father was diabetic and had heart problems. Mother died in her 30's. The patient does not know the cause of death. The patient had one brother who died in his 50's from diabetic complications. He had two sister who died of diabetic complications. Of his two living sisters, one of them is also a diabetic. The patient's daughters are not diabetic. There is no known family history of neuromuscular disorders.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Range of motion of the neck is limited. Head turning 45 degrees to either side. Limited neck extension. Negative straight-leg raising. Negative spine tenderness. Regular cardiac rhythm, no heart murmur. Negative carotid bruits. In the supine position, blood pressure 105\/50, heart rate 60 and regular. Upon standing, blood pressure dropped to 60\/40, heart rate remained 60. The patient was asymptomatic.\n\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Mental status: Alert, coherent and appropriate. The patient knows the name of his physician, Dr. Duvall, Dr. Villagomez, and Dr. Goldberg at Pioneer Home.\n\nCranial nerves: Visual fields full. Visual acuity with reading glasses 20\/30 on the right, 20\/20 -1 on the left. Extraocular movements full. No nystagmus. Pupils sluggishly reactive to light. Optic discs flat bilaterally. No facial asymmetry. The tongue and soft palate move symmetrically.\n\nMotor examination: Atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous and ADM, worse on the left hand. No atrophy of the abductor pollicis brevis. Negative arm drift. Motor strength testing 5\/5 in all muscles of both upper extremities except for 4\/5 weakness of the first dorsal interosseous and abductor digiti minimi bilaterally. No weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis on either hand. Motor strength testing of the lower extremities 5\/5 except for mild weakness of toe extensors 4+\/5 bilaterally. The patient was able to walk on his toes and heels while holding onto the examiner. Deep tendon reflexes 2+ bilaterally at the biceps, triceps, and knees. Absent ankle jerks bilaterally. Toes downgoing. No spasticity of the lower extremities.\n\nSensory examination: Significant for absent pin prick sensation in both feet up to the level of the knees. Pin prick sensation is diminished in the dorsal aspect of all fingers and the palmar aspect of both hands. Vibratory sensation absent in the toes, intact at the ankles and knees bilaterally. Intact vibratory sensation in the upper extremities. Romberg test significant for body swaying, but the patient did not fall. Tandem gait was poor, but improved when holding the examiner. No limb ataxia.\n\nLABORATORY DATA: Review of previous laboratory tests of May, 2145, BUN 36, creatinine 1.7, glucose 310. December, 2144, TSH normal. October, 2143, B12 normal. Negative RPR. The patient said he was tested negative for HIV in 2142, and 2143. MRI of the brain in 2142 and 2143 revealed bilateral white matter changes in the cerebral hemisphere without any intracranial mass lesion.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: In summary, we have a 63-year-old diabetic man who appears to have significant sensorimotor polyneuropathy with autonomic involvement. He does have constipation and impotence as well as orthostatic hypotension.\n\nAs we discussed on the phone, his antihypertensive medications need to be adjusted and the patient will be following up with you regarding this. He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left. The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses.\n\nMRI of the cervical spine was also ordered to rule out any cord compression which may also contribute to loss of sensation in the legs. The patient does have a history of traumatic cervical herniated disk in 2125. He may also have had a left elbow injury at this time which can make him prone to develop tardy ulnar palsy.\n\nThe patient will return for a follow-up visit after the above tests.\n\nThank you again for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nStanly Lang, M.D.\n\n\ncc: Dr. T.

He has had LBP for at least three years which is located in his mid lumbar region, non radiating, worse with standing. The pain had progressed such that he has a very poor performance status. He cannot stand but for a few minutes at a time. He denies focal wekness. He had an MRI of the LS spine 2\/02\/47 which revealed heterogeneous marrow concernig for an infiltrating process in his marrow. He has had an SPEP which was normal, he has had a bone scan which was negatvie. He does not have an elevated protein or globulin fraction. His CRI is longstanding and attributed to his DM. He was set up for a outpt BM bx to evaluate the marrow process, but the pain has been so severe, he was admitted for an inpatient work up. Of note he has longstanding anemia related to his CRI, perhaps anemia of chronic disease. He denies any weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats, decreased appetite. He does report fatigue which has become progressive.\n\nPMH:\n1. DM\n2. autonomic dysfunction with orthostatic hypotension\n3. diabetic retinopathy\n4. depression\n5. CRI\n6. OA\n7. H\/o TB 2132\n8.

The pain has progressed to a significant level such that he spends most of his day in bed. He did have an MRI of the L\/S spine which was negative except it did reveal heterogeous uptake in the vertebral and pelvic bone marrow. They raised the question of multiple myeloma or another infiltrative process. He does have renal insufficiency, but no other abnormalities to suggest MM. We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out. Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded. In addition, he has a hx of a positive PPD, unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically. Is any of this TB?

Lynn, M.D.\nDoraville County Health Center\n897 Cider Street\nPlatteville, HI 79812\n\nRE: Isabelle Y. Quick\nATCH: 655-75-45\n\nDear Harry and Yair:\n\nMy thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance. As you know, she is just 52 years of age. Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year. She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband. She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease. She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations. On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft. This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side. In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins. There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent. She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit. By last spring, i.e. a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication. She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks. Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss. Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left. Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (? length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff. Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations. She has sought an opinion here in this regard. She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy. On physical examination blood pressure was 140\/80. Pulse was 70 and regular. Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits. She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse. There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse. She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.\n\nThis is of course a very unhappy situation. Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good. However I am not absolutely ruling this out. I would suggest the following. Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix. Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit. She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me. If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered. I will get back to you after review of the films themselves. My thanks once again. With every best wish.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nDaniel W. Iniguez, M.D.\n\ncc: Yair K.

Over the past month, however, the patient reports that she has had progressive pain in her R foot and leg, which wakes her up from sleep almost every night. She can walk less than one block without disabling claudication which improves with rest. She also has noticed discoloration of her R foot, along with numbness and paresthesias, which have been progressive over the same time period.\n\nShe denies all symptoms other than RLE pain and claudication as described. Specifically, she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, and fevers\/chills.

The patient presents complaining of lower back pain with right lower extremity radiation. He develop symptoms gradually three months ago with no history of preceding trauma. The symptoms became progressively worse. The patient has a history of lower back injury 30 years ago in a motor vehicle accident - at that time he was diagnosed with disc rupture. Currently the pain is intermittent and occurs daily. He grades the intensity of the pain as up to 7 to 8 out of 10 on the numerical pain scale. He describes it as sharp shooting sensation in the lower back with radiation all the way down right lower extremity to the foot. The symptoms are worse with standing; better with sitting and lying down. There is no change in the intensity of symptoms with coughing or sneezing. The patient any recent fever or chills, no loss of bowel or bladder control. He describes occasional intermittent numbness in the right leg and foot. He denies any weakness.

Lumbar radiculitis. 3. Degenerative disc disease. 4. Lumbar spondylosis. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. MRI study of the lumbar spine will be obtained to further evaluate etiology of ongoing symptoms. The patient will discuss with radiologist if MRI study can not be performed due to cardiac stents. 2. Upon review of the imaging studies, a lumbar epidural steroid injection would be considered to decrease the inflammatory component of his symptoms and to inhibit peripheral nociceptive transmission. 3. The patient was encouraged to remain active and to participate in low-impact aerobic exercises to prevent deconditioning. He was encouraged to continue with weight loss program. 4. The therapeutic plan was discussed with the patient. All of his questions were answered. He will be seen in follow-up after imaging study is completed in 1-2 weeks.\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient.

As per report, the patient felt\nlightheaded and passed out while he was shaving. The patient\npassed out while using in the bathroom. The patient was actually\ncaught by son before he actually hit the floor. The patient did\nnot strike his head. There was no loss of consciousness. The\npatient then awoke once he was supine. The patient later felt\nnormal. The patient states that he did have some antecedent\ndiaphoresis and shortness of breath and possible chest\npalpitations. The patient states that he felt like something was\njumping inside his body. The patient does complain of some\nfatigue and malaise. The patient denies having any lower\nextremity swelling or pain. The patient denies having any chest\npain at this time. The patient did have an adenosine MIBI in\nMarch 2095, which showed some areas of reversible ischemia over\nthe distribution of the left circumflex artery. The patient's\ntransthoracic echocardiogram from March 2095 did show some LVH as\nwell as for an ejection fraction of 50% with some global\nhypokinesis. The patient was seen by his primary care physician,\nspecifically, Dr. Ross. The patient was instructed to come to\nthe Emergency Department for further evaluation and admission.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient's vital signs revealed the\nfollowing: The patient's temperature was 99 degrees Fahrenheit.\nHeart rate 63 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per\nminute, blood pressure is 151\/18, and oxygen saturation was\ninterpreted as normal. General: Mild-to-moderate discomfort\nnoted, daughter at bedside, pleasant. HEENT: The patient's head\nis normocephalic and atraumatic, no scalp hematomas. Mucous\nmembranes were somewhat dry. Posterior oropharynx was clear.\nNeck: Supple, no JVD. Respiratory: Clear to auscultation\nbilaterally. No focal rhonchi, rales, or wheezes.\nCardiovascular: Irregularly irregular, distant heart sounds, no\ndefinite murmurs, rubs, or gallops were appreciated. GI:\nAbdomen: Soft, no rebound or guarding, no focal tenderness to\npalpation, no palpable pulsatile mass appreciated. Rectal exam\ndeferred. GU exam deferred. Skin: Warm and dry, no rash or\nlesions were noted. Back: No costovertebral angle tenderness.\nThere was no presacral edema. Extremities: Warm and well\nperfused, trace lower extremity edema noted, no asymmetrical\nlower extremity edema. There were no palpable cords. Neuro:\nThe patient was alert and oriented x3, motor, strength, and\nsensation were all grossly intact. The patient's cranial nerves\nare grossly intact. I did not ambulate the patient.\nINITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a 70-year-old male\nwith a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart\nfailure, prior transient ischemic attack, and atrial fibrillation\nfor which he is on Coumadin, who presents with a syncopal\nepisode. The patient was sent in to the Emergency Department for\nfurther evaluation and workup for this syncopal event.\nDifferential diagnosis at this time includes a syncopal event\nsecondary to dehydration versus arrhythmia. I do not feel that\nthe patient had a cerebrovascular accident. The patient will\nneed to have screening laboratory studies and formal imaging.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: Upon arrival to the Emergency\nDepartment, the patient had history and physical exam performed.\nThe patient then had a 12-lead EKG performed. The patient's\n12-lead EKG was consistent with atrial fibrillation with some\nT-wave flattening noted. There were no definite acute ischemic\nchanges appreciated. The patient had laboratory studies sent.\nThe patient's laboratory studies were notable for a creatinine of\n1.69. The patient does have a history of renal insufficiency.\nThe patient's cardiac markers were negative. The patient's BNP\nwas elevated at 1380. The patient's complete blood count was\nnormal. The patient's coagulation studies were normal patient's\ncoagulation studies were notable for an INR of 2.2. The patient\nthen had a noncontrast head CT scan performed. The patient's\nnoncontrast head CT scan results are still pending at this time.\nThe patient also had a 2-view chest x-ray ordered. The patient's\nchest x-ray results are also still pending at this time. Dr.\nRoss kindly and promptly saw the patient here in the Emergency\nDepartment. He was in agreement with admitting the patient to\nInternal Medicine at this time. The patient will be admitted\nto a monitor bed. The patient will need to rule out for possible\nacute coronary syndrome or cardiac ischemia. The patient will\nneed further monitoring for possible arrhythmia. The patient was\nin agreement with this plan for admission at this time.\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSES:\n1. Syncopal event, possibly secondary to an arrhythmia.\n2. Atrial fibrillation.\n3. Renal insufficiency.\nDISPOSITION: The patient was admitted to Internal Medicine\nand to a monitor bed.\nCONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION: Stable and satisfactory.\n\nJUSTUS, ELLIS M.D.\nD: 05\/15\/95\nT: 05\/15\/95\nDictated By: JUSTUS, ELLIS\neScription document:4-4238782 IFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2095-06-27\nProblem List 1) CAD -Cath: 5\/95: LAD (Proximal), Discrete Discrete 70% lesion; LAD (Mid), Discrete Discrete 80% lesion DIAG1 (Proximal), Discrete Discrete 95% lesion Left Circumflex Artery CX (Mid), Discrete Discrete 95% lesion MARG1 (Ostial), Discrete Discrete 95% lesion.

Dear Dr. Regan:\nI had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Percy Root in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Shady Brook Hospital today. As you know, he is a 70-year-old man who is s\/p CABG in May of this year. Today he is doing well folloing his surgery.\n\nHis past medical history is significant for a coronary artery disease, status post IMI,afib, CABG, PPM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, question of an old stroke. His current medications include aspirin 81 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, lisinorpill 40 mg, Toprol-XL 10 mg, Prilosec 20 mg, Zocor 40 mg, Hydralazine.Coumadin as directed.\nAllergies: No known drug allergies.\nHe lives in Claxton with his wife, daughter, and grandkids and son-in-law. He does not drink, smoke or use IV drugs. He is originally from England.\nFamily History: noncontributory.\nOn physical examination, his heart rate was 60 and regular, his blood pressure was 125\/70. Carotids are 2+, good upstrokes, no bruits. Jugular venous pressure was flat. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. He had a regular rate and rhythm with a 2\/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border. Abdomen was benign. No clubbing, cyanosis or edema of the extremities. Good peripheral pulses.\n\n\nIn summary, this is a 70-year-old man with coronary artery disease, At this time he is NYHA II. Hre appears a bit volume overloaded. I will add ACE and lasix. Follow up in 1 month.\n\nXavier Ross, M.D.\n\n* Record date: 2095-12-21\n\n\nDecember 21, 2095\n\nAttending Note\nI performed a history and neurological examination of the patient and discussed his management with the resident. I reviewed the resident's note and agree with his documented findings and plan of care.\nThe patient is a 71 year old man with HTN, DM and high cholesterol, PPM on coumadin for AF, glaucoma, who presented 4 w\/a with R facial droop and dysarthria lasting < 1 minute. Was admitted for TIA w\/u and CT scan was negative. CTA was also normal. He had had a similar episode in the UK in the past. Was started on a statin and ASA and discharged. His wife feels he may not be that compliant but his INR was 2.3 today. It had been 2 when he came in with the TIA>\nThe exam today showed: Acuity was 20\/70 OD and Hand motions OS. Left APD Fundi with large C\/D OD and diffuse pallor OS with an opticociliary shunt vessel along the nasal disc. Right facial weakness in the sense of eyebrow drop and less wrinkles in the forehead but smile equal. Was not in UMN fashion. Motor, sensory, gait otherwise normal.\nAssessment: Status post TIA possibly related to AF\nLeft optic neuropathy with signs of chronic compression or ischemia. The latter is more likely cause (especially since I did not see any mass lesion compressing the L optic nerve on the CT) and is proably secondary to glaucoma.\nPlan: Reviewed coumadin food rules with him. Continue ASA and coumadin and statin Continued HTN and DM control Will touch base with ophthalmology regarding the left optic neuropathy\nReturn in 6 months.\n\nSincerely,\n\nVictor Meadows, M.D. Shady Brook Hospital Neurology\n745-456-4769 vmeadows@sbhnc.org\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2062-11-29\nNovember 29, 2062 Benjamin Taylor, M.D. 58 Cathedral Circle Three Rivers, NM 34963 RE: Kathy Joshi ILC #158-42-11-2 Dear Dr. Taylor: Mrs. Joshi returns after a one year hiatus. She continues to complain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionally secondary to exertion. These episodes occur on a roughly once a month basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes. Addition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had no effect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she does not take Nitroglycerin for it. A stress test performed last January showed Mrs. Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 30 seconds of a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 119, peak blood pressure of 150\/70 secondary to dyspnea. She had no ischemic EKG changes noted, however, a simultaneously obtained Sesta-MIBI scan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a small surrounding area of transient ischemia. In addition, there was a moderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri- infarct mild ischemia. Of note, her last serum cholesterol was 266 with an HDL of 52 and an LDL of 192. She remains on a regimen of Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d, aspirin 1 tab p.o. q.d, Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d, NPH 12 units S.C. q a.m. with 6 units CZI S.C. q a.m, and 15 units NPH S.C. q p.m. Physical exam reveals a well nourished, overweight woman in no acute distress. Blood pressure right arm sitting 160\/90, heart rate 67 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 264 pounds, which is six pounds above her weight of one year ago. The neck is supple. JVP flat. Carotids are 2 + without bruits. Chest Page 2 Kathy Joshi ILC #158-42-11-2 11-29-62 remains clear. Cardiac exam reveals normal S1, physiologically split S2 and a soft I\/VI systolic ejection murmur. The abdomen is benign. Extremities without appreciable edema. Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 67, P-R interval .22, QRS .10, Q-T .36, axis 20 degrees. There are isolated atrial premature depolarizations noted along with first degree AV block and a prior inferior posterior myocardial infarction with minor nonspecific ST and T wave changes. Compared to his last electrocardiogram there has been no significant change. Impression: Mrs. Joshi continues to have evidence of mild, stable angina. I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q h.s. for her significant hyperlipidemia and I strongly encouraged her to more aggressively try to lower her caloric intake and increase her aerobic activity level. In addition, I have asked her to obtain her blood pressure at least two or three more times on an ambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above 140\/85 then I would consider initiating pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy. In addition, as long as she remains active and asymptomatic, I will plan on repeating her exercise MIBI stress test in one to one and a half years time. Beyond this I have not altered her present regimen. Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care. Respectfully yours, Brandon W.

Blood pressure right arm sitting at 106\/62,\nheart rate 65 and irregularly regular, respirations 16 and\nunlabored, weight 306 lbs, which is 6 lbs above her weight 10\nmonths ago. The neck is soft. JVP is flat. Carotids without\nsignificant bruits. Chest is clear. Cardiac exam reveals a\nnormal S1, a physiologically split S2, with a1-2\/6 systolic\nmurmur radiating from apex to the base. No significant diastolic\nmurmur or rub. The abdomen is obese, but otherwise benign.\nExtremities reveal 1-2+ bipedal edema, peripheral pulses are\nintact albeit mildly diminished.\n\nElectrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with a variable QRS\nresponse. The P waves are more organized than one might usually\nsee, suggesting the possibility of fibrillation\/flutter as well.\nQRS 0.11, QT 0.38, axis 90 degrees, there is evidence of a prior\ninferior myocardial infarction. Compared with his last\nelectrocardiogram, there is no significant change.\n\nImpression: Mrs. Joshy continues to suffer from morbid obesity,\nand I had a long discussion with her and her daughter regarding\nthe essential nature of her engaging in an aggressive weigh\nreduction program. I once again have strongly encouraged her to\nmake an appointment with our obesity clinic to assist in\nextensive weight reduction. I also discussed with her my\nconcerns regarding her symptoms of slowly progressive peripheral\nedema, particularly as it pertains both to her weight, and atrial\nor tachyarrhythmias. As in the past, she told me that she would\nrefuse any consideration for attempted cardioversion or other\nstudies. She did, however, agree to continue with her current\nmedical regimen. I obtained routine blood studies today to\nverify the adequacy of her lipid control and diabetes management.\nI have introduced her to Hayden Nutter, her nurse practitioner, who\nwill assist in trying to achieve a little more diuresis overt he\nnext few weeks. We have given her a prescription for Zaroxylyn\nto begin at 2.5 mg p.o. q.d, which will help result in some\ndegree of mild diuresis. Nonetheless, she understands that\nsignificant weight loss can only occur through a weight reduction\nprogram. I have of course explained to her the increased cardiac\nmorbidity associated with her current lifestyle. Beyond this, I\nhave not altered her current medical regimen.\n\nOf course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in his care.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDictated By: Brandon Neilson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrandon Neilson, M.D.\n\n\neScription document:8-5334486 AFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 10\/01\/70\nDT: 10\/02\/70\nDV: 10\/01\/70\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2071-07-20\nEDVISIT^15842112^Joshi, Kathy^07\/20\/71^KATZ, LAURA\nThis patient was seen, interviewed, and examined by myself\nprimarily.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65-year-old female who\npresents with body swelling and shortness of breath. The patient\nis unable to say when she specifically noted her lower extremity\nswelling. She states that approximately 1 year prior to arrival\nshe had to throw out all of her shoes except for 2 pairs because\nall those shoes had become tight. At the present time, the\npatient is only able to wear sandals and apparently her\nco-workers noted her to be significantly swollen and suggested\nthat she see a physician. The patient states that there was no\nacute change in her swelling today. She states that she has had\na cough for 1 month. Again, there was no acute change. Today,\nshe denies any chest pain at any time. She does complain of\ndyspnea and specifically dyspnea on exertion, no PND, no\northopnea, and no change in her overall energy level.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: MI, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes\nmellitus.\nMEDICATIONS: Coumadin, aspirin, insulin, Lasix, and Avapro.\nOtherwise as per the written note.\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for no tobacco use, no alcohol use.\nThe patient works as an animal trainer. She lives with family.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She denies fevers or chills, chest pain or\npalpitations, abdominal pain, or dark stools.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a well-developed, well-nourished\nfemale, edematous. Temperature 100.9, pulse 97, respiratory rate\nof 22, blood pressure is 178\/64, and oxygen saturation is 89% on\nroom air and 94% on 2 L nasal cannula. HEENT is normocephalic\nand atraumatic. Moist mucous membranes. Extraocular motions are\nintact. Sclerae are anicteric. Neck is supple. Full range of\nmotion. JVD is difficult to assess due to the patient's body\nhabitus. Lungs: Positive crackles in the lower 1\/4 of the lung\nfield bilaterally. There is no dullness to percussion. Cardiac:\nIrregularly regular, not tachycardic, no murmur is auscultated.\nRectal: Heme-negative stool. Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds,\nsoft, distended, no fluid wave, no hepatomegaly is palpated but\npalpation is somewhat limited by the patient's body habitus.\nSkin is warm, dry, and intact. There are various ecchymotic\nlesions on the extremities. Extremities: 2+ edema of the\nbilateral lower extremities in the mid thighs. Neurologic:\nAlert and oriented x3. Follows all commands appropriate. Short\nand long-term memories are intact.\nLABORATORY DATA: Significant for a chest x-ray which has a\nright-sided pleural effusion and increased pulmonary vasculature\nas well as stable cardiomegaly. Glucose of 223, BUN of 31, a\ncreatinine of 1.2, bicarbonate of 24, CK of 87, BNP of 2570, MB\nof 0.9, and troponin which is less than assay. White count of\n5.1, hematocrit of 34.2, and platelets of 124,000. INR of 4.6.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was seen, interviewed,\nand examined in the Emergency Department with labs and studies\nobtained as documented above. Her past medical records were\nreviewed. The patient is in congestive heart failure. She\nreceived Lasix and lisinopril as well as aspirin while in the\nEmergency Department and she has been diuresing appropriately\nafter receiving the Lasix. She has been supplemented with oxygen\nby nasal cannula. The source of her fever is not clear. She\nwill need to have a repeat chest x-ray as her pulmonary edema\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\nevidence of cellulitis. UA is pending. The patient also needs\nserial cardiac enzymes and an echocardiogram but this will be\nhandled by the inpatient department. I did speak with the patient's\ncardiologist and she will be admitted to the Cardiology Service.\nDIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.\nDISPOSITION: The patient is admitted in satisfactory condition.\n\nKATZ, LAURA M.D.\nD: 07\/20\/71\nT: 07\/20\/71\nDictated By: KATZ, LAURA\neScription document:1-9370540 BFFocus\n\n\n* Record date: 2072-07-06\n\n\n\nJOSHI, KATHY\n15842112\n07\/06\/2072\n\n\nBenjamin W. Taylor, M.D.\nIllini Community Hospital\n66 Cardinal Circle\nThree Rivers, NM 11424\n\nDear Dr. Taylor:\n\nMrs. Joshi returns to the office for routine followup. Since last seen, she apparently was without evidence of increasing BUN and creatinine and for this reason was advised to transiently hold both her lisinopril and Zaroxolyn. By doing so, her creatinine fell from 2.2 to 1.6 and BUN from 117 to 57. She subsequently has resumed her lisinopril therapy, as apparently her blood pressure increased off her ACE inhibitor. In addition, as part of her followup last March, she underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test during which time she achieved a peak heart rate of 65, peak blood pressure of 129\/50, stopping because she reached the end of the adenosine infusion protocol. Her gated SPECT imaging demonstrated a global left ventricular ejection fraction of 38% with a mildly dilated left ventricle and akinesis of the basal inferoseptal and entire inferior wall. Her rest-stress perfusion imaging showed similarly a large fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and basal inferoseptal wall without any area of reversible ischemia. Her last echocardiogram performed in July 2071 showed a residual of left ventricular ejection fraction mildly reduced at 45% with severe inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis. In addition, at that time showed evidence for trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and her echo was essentially unchanged from her prior study in March 2071.\n\nCurrently, she is concerned primarily about her inability to lose weight, and in fact states that during a recent vacation she actually discontinued her diet. Presently, she continues on a regimen of Toprol-XL 37.5 mg p.o. daily, simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, lisinopril 5 mg p.o. daily, potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d, furosemide 160 mg p.o. b.i.d, Coumadin, enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Niferex 150 mg p.o. daily, Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.a.m. and Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.p.m.\n\nPhysical exam reveals a pleasant, mildly overweight woman in no acute distress. Blood pressure right arm sitting 120\/52, heart rate 45 and irregularly regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 253 pounds, which is 12 pounds above her weight of six months ago. The neck is supple. JVP is flat. Carotids are without significant bruits. Chest remains clear. Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base. No significant diastolic murmur or rub. The abdomen is overweight, but otherwise benign without evidence of abdominal aneurysm or bruit. Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema. Peripheral pulses are detectable, albeit mildly diminished.\n\nElectrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation flutter with at times of significant AV block with pauses as high as approximately 2 seconds. There is evidence of a prior inferior myocardial infarction and minor nonspecific ST and T-wave changes. Compared with her last electrocardiogram, her heart rate at times is slower.\n\nImpression: Ms. Joshi remains stable from a cardiovascular perspective, however, I am obviously concerned about her potential for lightheadedness in light of her bradycardia. I have asked her to decrease her Toprol-XL to 25 mg p.o. daily and to repeat an EKG four to five days after doing so. I of course have reminded her as to the importance of getting in contact with you or myself straight away should she develop any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or dizziness. She understands that she may require a permanent pacemaker in the future. Most recent blood studies show a significantly elevated glucose of 183 (she states she is trying to tailor her insulin regimen with you) and in January, normal liver function studies except for an alkaline phosphatase of 304 and lipid profile last September notable for a cholesterol of 134, triglyceride of 74, HDL 58, and LDL 61. She understands the importance of continuing to adhere to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet while remaining on her antilipemic therapy. She will discuss with you and her nephrologist the optimal management of her mild renal insufficiency. In light of both her diabetes and coronary disease, it certainly would be optimal if possible to continue her on her ACE inhibitor. At the present time, she does not meet criteria for prophylactic placement of an AICD and her New York Heart Association class I to II status precludes the need for consideration of biventricular pacing. Other than reducing her beta-blocker regimen as described above, I have not further altered her current medical program.\n\nI thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\nBrandon W Neilson, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-2421626 RU\n\nCC: James Nolen M.D.\n48 Auburn Street\nRehoboth, NM 42761\n\n\nDD: 07\/06\/72\nDT: 07\/07\/72\nDV: 07\/06\/72\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2115-11-24\n\n\nNeurology Resident Admit Note\n\nDate: 11\/23\/15\n\nPatient Name: Travis, Peggy\nMRN: 0834010\nPCP name: Richard Verlin-Urbina\n\nAge: 54 Gender: Female\n\nChief Complaint: Confusion?

He has had a series of illness over the spring, beginning with a hospitalization for pneumonia in June. He later developed what was thought to be a splenic subcapsular hematoma (on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation) and then subsequently developed LUQ pain and was found to have a splenic abscess that was drained. In the course of this illness, he also developed an ischemic R foot and was found (at what stage?) to have a popliteal aneurysm.\n\nAt the time of his admission, he was found to have diabetes. He has been treated with Lantus insulin, most recently 15 Units at bedtime, on which regimen he has had consistent overnight drops, often to hypoglycemic levels.

Mr. Jain was admitted to my service in transfer for right lower extremity ischemia and gangrene following atheroembolization from a popliteal aneurysm, as you know. He was admitted in early September and stayed until early October. During his hospital stay here his wounds were addressed. He underwent angiograms to evaluate his arterial anatomy and he underwent reconstruction of the right wherein covered stent graft was used to cover disease in his proximal femoral artery and then he underwent an above knee to below knee popliteal artery bypass using PTFE with ligation of the aneurysm. He also subsequently underwent angioplasty of his posterior tibial artery. Given his atheroembolic phenomenon he had very limited vasculature remaining in the foot and I was concerned that the forefoot gangrene would progress and he would wind up losing the right foot. In the interim since his discharge he appears to be doing quite well. The gangrene of the right foot has remained stable with clearcut demarcation of the right first, second and third toes. He also has some heel ulceration that I am hoping to nurse through. He denies any rest pain or pain in the foot. He has no evidence of fevers, chills, rigors or shakes in the interim. He has since been discharged to home and has been walking with a walking shoe. His left lower extremity aneurysm is yet to be treated and he has not developed any symptoms with regards to the left lower extremity. He has been taking his Coumadin regularly and has had therapeutic INRs as he reports.\nOn exam today he is doing quite well. He is in good spirits and appears much better than in the hospital. His head and neck exams were unremarkable. His lungs were clear. Heart was regular. His proximal groin and leg incisions have healed up nicely, however there is some dry eschar on the midportion of the wound. With regards to the toes he has clearcut demarcation and heel ulceration. There is no evidence of cellulitis, induration or infection of the right lower extremity. He continues to have a stable looking foot on the left. Given his extensive peripheral vascular disease I performed PVRs in the office today, which revealed that he has pulsatile PVRs at the right calf and ankle. He also has slight pulsatile PVRs at the right transmetatarsal level. This bodes well with regards to his revascularization as well as his potential to either heal or remain stable with regards to the necrosis on the right foot. His left calf, ankle and transmetatarsal PVRs were similar.\nIn summary, this is an unfortunate gentleman who developed atheroembolic phenomena resulting in digital ischemia as well as heel ischemia with the potential for limb loss in the near future of the right lower extremity. He does have an untreated aneurysm on the left with potential for atheroembolization of the left lower extremity. Given this concern, I will proceed next with a left lower extremity revascularization to exclude the popliteal aneurysm so that he does not develop limb-threatening gangrene of the left. With regards to the right I will try to initiate some hyperbaric oxygen therapy and will probably re-evaluate his distal circulation with an angiogram at the time of his next admission or some time thereafter. I am hoping to facilitate healing of the heel wound with the final outcome of a transmetatarsal amputation of the right lower extremity but will see how it goes. My thanks again for this referral. I apologize for not sending you correspondence earlier. With this correspondence I will send you his operative diagram as well as his most recent discharge summary.\nSincerely,\n\nQuincy T.

Briefly, the history is as follows: The patient is a 47 year old male with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis who was referred for abdominal discomfort and fever. His abdominal discomfort had begun within the preceding 24 hours and had gradually worsened. He had pain in the left lower quadrant radiating to the rectal area. He did have one diarrheal bowel movement. He specifically denied bleeding. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL APPEARANCE: The patient was awake and alert, although somewhat sluggish and apparently uncomfortable. VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure was 177\/90, pulse 117, initial temperature 103.3, respiratory rate 20. HEENT: Pupils were equal. Sclerae were anicteric. The oropharynx showed normal architecture. NECK: Supple. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. LUNGS: The breath sounds were essentially clear. ABDOMEN: There was mild to moderate diffuse tenderness. No definite mass can be appreciated. Bowel sounds were diminished. RECTAL: Stool is guaiac-negative, per the resident's examination. EXTREMITIES: Examination of the left thigh showed slight drainage at a recent surgical incision site. LABORATORY EVALUATION: Electrolytes showed sodium 139, potassium 4.3, chloride 99, CO2 27, BUN 12, creatinine 2.2, glucose 230. White blood cell count was 30,000, hematocrit 38. Chest x-ray showed no definite infiltrate. Abdominal x-ray showed dilated loops of small bowel. EKG showed no change from previous tracings. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: The assessment and plan were reviewed with the resident. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: I confirm the provisional diagnosis of abdominal pain with question of deep venous thrombosis versus sepsis from as yet unidentified source. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): The care plan was reviewed. The patient was started on antibiotics and ultimately admitted to the hospital for definitive evaluation and further care. RD883\/1008 FRANK E.

As you know, Mr. Branche underwent a left femoral to posterior tibial bypass one month ago followed by amputation of a gangrenous first toe. After being discharged from our service he was readmitted to the Medical Service with a severe case of C. difficile colitis. Ultimately this resolved and he was discharged. Today he reports that the diarrhea has again resumed and he was placed back on an oral antibiotic yesterday. He complains of only mild incisional discomfort in his left leg. On examination, there is a strong pulse easily palpated over the left lower extremity bypass graft. The old right lower extremity bypass graft was also palpable. The left foot itself is warm. The great toe incision site, however, has developed necrotic tissue all along the incision, which was sharply debrided to clean margins. This will now need to be treated as an open wound. The calf portion of the left lower extremity incision also has a narrow zone of superficial skin slough which was gently debrided. The graft is not exposed and there are no deep wounds in the leg. Mr. Branche's left lower extremity bypass graft is functioning well. However, he will require significant ongoing wound care for the immediate future. Daily dressing changes will be arranged with visiting nurse services. We plan to follow him closely and an appointment was given for two weeks. Thanks again for allowing us to participate in the care of this delightful and challenging patient and please don't hesitate to contact me at any time if I can RE: Branche, Earnest MRN: 53023691 7-8-81 Page 2 be of further assistance.

The resident's note was reviewed and the patient was interviewed and examined by me. HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT: The patient is a very pleasant, 50 year-old gentleman who presents with gross hematemesis and coffee-ground emesis. He had it during the night and then this morning developed coffee-grounds turned to red blood emesis. He denies any light-headedness, chest pain or abdominal pain. He has had some diarrhea over the last seven months, of unclear etiology. No melena. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Chronic renal failure, myocardial infarction, insulin dependent diabetes. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient was hemodynamically stable, well-appearing, nontoxic. LUNGS: Clear. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Soft with tenderness to palpation in the bilateral lower quadrants. NG tube lavage showed 200 cc of pink tinged fluid, cleared after 50 cc. LABORATORY EVALUATION: Hematocrit was 46, white count 11, potassium 6.6, moderately hemolyzed. BUN was 62, creatinine 6.9. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: The patient will be seen by the renal service and admitted to the medical service. The patient will need dialysis and endoscopy tomorrow. See resident's note for details. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Upper GI bleed. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): The patient was admitted in satisfactory condition.

Mr. Branch is now two years out from a right femoral- tibial bypass and nine months out from a left femoral-tibial bypass with subsequent transmetatarsal amputation of the left foot and split-thickness skin grafting. Over the last several months, he has been undergoing dressing changes to remaining, small, superficial, open wounds on the dorsum of the left foot. Over the last one to two weeks, he began to note the development of a new area of dark skin on the lateral aspect of the left foot and recently has noted some drainage. He denies any fevers. In addition and of note, he complains of recent onset of pain in the right eye and has an appointment at the Ophthalmology Clinic immediately following his visit with us. He last underwent vascular lab studies in September at which time both lower extremity bypass grafts were widely patent and without stenoses. On examination today, there are strong, easily palpable pulses over both lower extremity bypass grafts. The right foot is warm and without any new ischemic skin changes or lesions. On examination of the left foot, there is a large area of full- thickness skin necrosis on the lateral aspect of the foot where there had never been any previous open wounds. This area encompasses a significant proportion of the lateral aspect of the foot from the end of the transmetatarsal incision to the proximal mid foot. On probing, purulent material drains from the margins and there is obvious significant sepsis. The foot itself is warm and there is a good posterior tibial Doppler signal at the ankle. Unfortunately, Mr. Branch has developed a new, large wound on the left foot which likely began as a pressure (decubitus) ulceration due to his severe neuropathy. This is now complicated by significant local sepsis and there is a large area of soft tissue loss on the foot. He will require urgent admission and operative debridement today. In addition, given the extent of the problem, it is likely that he will ultimately come to below-knee amputation in the end. Immediately following his visit to the Ophthalmology Clinic, he will be admitted to the RE:Branch, Earnest MRN:53023691 3-8-82 Page 2 hospital with the hopes of performing debridement and drainage later today. I will certainly continue to keep you apprised of his progress. Sincerely, Luis J.

He called into his cardiologist's office Queenie Yeargan on 01\/03\/29, who was being covered by Dr. Haynes to report increasing lower extremity edema and worsening shortness of breath. He was prescribed 5 mg of Zaroxolyn daily and had a 14 lb weight loss over the next three days. The patient developed weakness and continued to feel weak and lose weight despite discontinuing Zaroxolyn on 01\/05\/29 under the advise of Dr. Haynes. The patient did continue to take the rest of his medications. He reported to the ED for lab draw after reporting his symptoms to Dr. Quentin Lemus.\nIn the ED the patient had vitals of 98.5 80 107\/62 18 97% on RA. The patient was given 1L of NS, 500 mg levofloxacin, 30 U of NPH\/10 U of Regular, 100 mg of Lipitor, and 200 mg of Zoloft.\nThe patient noted a decreased amount of concentrated foul smelling urine, worsening SOB, and dry cough.

Avoiding all salt in diet with good compliance. Did see sleep lab tech, tried new settings and mask on new machine, but still tolerates poorly. When discussed in some detail, notes feelings of suffocation with wearing mask for any period of time. Also notes sense of being tied down frrom mask very difficult to tolerate. Without exploring details greatly, we discussed potential role of PTSD in precipitating symptoms related to mask use, and potentially the effect of nocturnal hypoxia and RV strain on accumulation of fluid. Improving tolerance of CPAP seems very key. Pt has started atkins dt with good success (6# in first week), and improving BGs are requiring reduction in insulin, which is great. so it seems that addressing OSA is the key to improving overall status now. We discussed some options.Including potential for tracheostomy to fix this without having to address mask, but agreed to try to initiate trial of CBT to see if we can improve mask talerance with symptom reduction. He remains quite clear that he has no interest in furhter exploring the PTSD history, and I reassured him that CBT does not require doing this.\n\nOSA: Likely has near optimal mask set up now.We'll explore potential for CBT with sleep center or perhaps cardiac rehab source. Hopefully this would address fluid imbalance to a greater extent as well.\n\nDM: improving with wt loss and diet. Agree with insulin taper as sugars drop.

A cardiac echo revealed EF of 64% with no valvular disease and normal wall motion. An Aden MIBI 4\/25 revealed inferior and PL ischemia and he was taken to the cath lab. The cath revealed mild pulmonary hypertension, PCW of 14, co-dominance with 65% PDA, moderate LCX disease and severe proximal LAD lesion. HE subsequently underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD, radial artery to LCX and VG to PDA. 1\/26 he noted progressive DOE with upper chest discomfort and was brought to the cath lab. His PA pressure was 45\/20 with a PCW of 20, all grafts were open and his BB and lasix were increased.\nAn Aden MIBI 12\/27 showed an EF of 60% w small PB scar & inferior-lateral ischemia. Echo 2\/28 revealed new LA enlargement with EF of 62%. He was admitted 1\/29 with HF exacerbation\/acute renal failure in the setting of rapid out-patient diureses with zaroxolyn. (BUN 74, creat 2.2) Diuretics as well as Glucophage and ACE I were held and he was discharged with a creat of 1.2. An echo revealed new mild MR and RF of 59%.\nOver the last few months he has noted episodes of sudden lightheadedness\/dizziness, floaters. He would take his BP with a home machine and it could be as low as 77\/47. In addition, he has noted progressive DOE as well an now rest angina that is requiring a SL TNG for relief. He has 3 flights of stairs to climb to his apartment and uses 1 SL TNG prophylactically.\nAn exercise adenosine MIBI was done 6\/14 which revealed an EF of 75% with mild anterior and IPL ischemia. He was admitted for a cardiac cath 6\/20, however due to a creatinine of 2.4 only a right heart cath was done. It revealed RAP of 7, RVP of 36\/17, PAP of 35\/17, PCW of 17 and CO 5.9.\nGiven his episodes of sudden hypotension as well as increasing creatinine, Diltiazem as well as Ramipril and Aldactone have been held. He reports no further episodes of hypotension since stopping these meds.\nHe is being followed by Dr You in renal service.\nOf note, he continues to use the oxygen at night.(2 liters NP)\n\nCardiac cath today revealed normal LM, TO mid LAD with LIMA to LAD filling distal LAD, mild LCX disease, RCA is totally occluded with distal vessel filling via VG to RPDA, VG to RCA small vessel but patent, LIMA to LAD patent. Althought the RA graft to the PDA and VG to LCX are patent - they are small and atretic.\n\nPast medical history:\nCAD\nIDDM x 10 yrs\nretinopathy s\/p laser\nHTN\nCRI\nOSA - can't tolerate CPAP\nLBP\nbilateral claudication if he walks fast\nreactive airway disease\nPTSD\nRecovering alcoholic - sober x 16 years\nremote ulcer - in his 20's\nCHF - dry wt 215\n\nPSHx:\nCABG 25 with LIMA to LAD, radial artery to RPDA, VG to LCX\n\nMedications (Confirmed):\n\naspirin 325 mg QD\nAtrovent 18 mcg\/spray inh tid\nFlonase 1 spray BID\nfurosemide 80 mg qam\nisosorbide mononitrate 30 mg qd\nLipitor 80 mg QHS\nNephrocaps 1 tab qd\nToprol XL 100 mg qd\nu100 NPH insulin\nZetia 10 mg qd\n\nAllergies:\n\nDrug reaction lisinopril causes cough\n\nFamily history:\nfather mild MI age 59\n\nSocial history:\ndivorced, quit smoking in 08, sober x 10 yrs, retired communications manager\n\nReview of systems:\ndenies ortho\/PND\/thyroid disease\/melena\/recent ulcer\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-BMI:\n-Pulse: 85\n-resp. rate: 16\n-height: 67 in.\n-weight: 220\n-General: No acute distress.\n-Skin: No rashes, anicteric.\n-Heent: Unremarkable\n-Neck: JVP flat but difficult to see. - carotids 2+, bilateral bruits R>L\n-Chest: Lungs clear anteriorly\n-Cardiac: He has a normal S1 and S2, and a soft systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border and apex\n-Abdomen: Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.\n-Extremities: right groin D&I, no hematoma or bruit DP\/PT 1+\/1+, left groin 2+, no bruit DP\/PT 1+\/1+\n-Neuro: A&O x3, CN 2-12 grossly intact.\n-BP: 139\/85\n\nEKG:\n75 RBBB - first degree AVB w PR .22\n\nSelected recent labs:\nMetabolic\nDate K CL CO2 BUN CRE GLU CA\n08\/09\/30 4.8 46 1.6\n08\/08\/30 100 30.9 263 9.2\n\nLiver and Pancreatic Enzymes\nDate ALB TP ALKP TBILI ALT\/SGPT AST\/SGOT\n07\/05\/30 4.1\n05\/30\/30 7.4 93 0.4 22 26\n\nHematology\nDate HCT RBC WBC PLT\n08\/01\/30 33.1 4.14 11.0 221\n\nCoagulation\nDate PT PT-INR PTT HCYS\/PBH\n08\/01\/30 12.0 1.0\n01\/09\/29 23.3\n07\/31\/27 10.9\n\nImmunology\nDate HGBA1C\n04\/11\/30 11.40\n\nother\nDate CORT RENIN\n07\/25\/30 37.0 8.9\n\n\n\n\nOther Data:\nPFT's 7\/26 VC 66%, FEV1\/VC 109%\n\nAssessment and plan:\n77 yo diabetic male admitted after cardiac catheterization for post hydration\n\nPlan:\nAdmit to Internal Medicine\nBedrest for 6 hours\nResume Lasix tonight - patient has not voided all day, just completing Bicarb drip\nFasting lipids, Lipo a, BNP in AM\nContinue to hold Ramipril, Aldactone and Diltiazem\nComplete Bicarb drip and total of 4 doses of Mucomyst\nFollow Renal function\nCNIS to evaluate carotid bruits\nContinue NPH BID - s\/s regular insulin as needed - especially given bicarb qtt in D5W\nNutrition consult for HBA1c 11.4, obesity\nPer Attending - medical management for now - RCA lesion is long, would be challenging and require significant dye - will increase Imdur to 60 qd\nWill need ABX prophylaxis for MR at discharge\n\nAndreea Marquez RN, MN # 1-3051\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\nNephrocaps 1 tab qd\nu100 NPH insulin Start: 08\/09\/2130\nFlonase 1 spray BID nasally\nAtrovent 18 mcg\/spray inh tid Start: 08\/09\/2130\nisosorbide mononitrate 30 mg qd\nToprol XL 100 mg qd\nLipitor 80 mg QHS\nZetia 10 mg qd\nfurosemide 80 mg qam in the and 80 mg in the qpm Start: 07\/13\/2130\naspirin 325 mg QD\n\nSigned electronically by Andreea Marquez RN, NP on Aug 10, 2130\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2083-07-20\nSILVER RIDGE EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT\n\nOROZCO,KYLE 560-40-78-5 VISIT DATE: 07\/20\/83\nPRESENTING COMPLAINT: Groin abscess.\nHISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT: This is a 58 year-old male who\nhad a renal catheterization via the right groin for renal artery\nstenosis on 8-09-83, who now comes in with progressive redness,\nswelling and some drainage over the last two days.

He is four weeks\nstatus post revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, which got\ninfected and had to be revised. He has been doing well, but now\npresents here with a low-grade fever to 100.9 degrees F. (he states\nhis maximum temperature at home was 101 degrees F, while he was\ntaking Advil for the fever). He presents for evaluation. He has\nhad no drainage from the site, and has been home on IV Nafcillin\nfor the past two months secondary to his graft infection.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.\nMEDICATIONS: IV Nafcillin, Lasix, Zocor, and insulin.\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The vital signs include a blood pressure of\n179\/85, a pulse of 91, respirations of 20, and a fever to 100.9\ndegrees F.

Known risk factors at that time (in addition to his age and gender) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking. Details of that presentation as per my 12\/16\/34 office note.\nEmergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory, one in the ditsal RCA and two in the PLV. The PLV lesions each received 2.5 x15mm Minivision (bare metal stents) and the distal RCA lesion received a 3.5 x15mm Vision (bare metal stent). A non-dominant Left Circumflex had a 70% stenosis that was not intervened upon. There was non-obstructive disease in the LAD.\nA transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of 54% and no wall motion abnormalities. Left atrium was slightly dilated to 39mm. RV function was normal.\nHe recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program (see below). He had an outpatient ETT-MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease. He had this on 12\/07\/34 and he exercised for 6 minutes, 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 70% of predicted. He did not experience chest pain, had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue. The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia. LV EF 63%.\nHe had a recurrent episode of chest pain (somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like) and presented to the ED in March. His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT-MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 10 sec, achieving 9 METS, 80% MPHR, peak double product 19K. A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not study-limiting. The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal, without evidence of ischemia or infarction. LV EF 68%.\nHe has overall done well since the time of his STEMI. He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab. He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI, and has remained abstinent since then. He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath. His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain.\nThree days ago he reports the onset of chest pain. This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time. Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG. He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work, and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities (i.e. muscolskeletal in nature). He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath, which has not changed since the onset of the CP. He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI, and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test. He denies lightheadedness or syncope. No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling.\nHe continues to be compliant with his medical regimen. He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy. He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes.\nPast medical history: 1) CAD status post inferior STEMI 11\/34 with 3 bare metal stents to RCA territory (1 in distal RCA and two in the PLV). Known residual LCx 70% lesion in a small, non-dominant vessel 2) Hypertension 3) Hyperlipideimia 4) Former smoker - quit at the time of his MI 5) Ankylosing spondylitis 6) Thrombophlebitis of the left leg, report of DVT in other notes\n\nChanges to Allergies NKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]\nMedications (Confirmed):\nASA Lipitor 20mg po daily lisinopril 10 mg po daily Niaspan Plavix 75mg po daily Toprol XL 25 mg PO daily\nPhysical examination: -Pulse: 50 regular -weight: 268 lbs. -General: Looks well, overweight, pleasant -HEENT: Jugular venous pressure 7cm, carotids 2+ bilaterally without bruits -Chest: CTAB -Cardiac: Point of maximal impulse is midclavicular; Distant, regular, S1 and S2, no murmurs or rubs -Abdomen: Soft, obese, non-tender -Extremities: No lower extremity edema, 2+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally -BP: 130\/75 both arms\nEKG: Baseline artifact, Sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm, clockwise rotation, minor nonspecific T wave changes; compared to 16-June-2135, the heart rate is slightly decreased, otherwise no important change.\nAssessment and plan: 60 year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI 11\/34 treated with 3 bare metal stents to the RCA territory, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease, although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days.\n1) Coronary artery disease: Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory, and he has now completed over a 12 month course of Plavix therapy. Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs (i.e. Motrin), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point.\nHe will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily, Lipitor 20mg daily, Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily. His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled.\nThe chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETT-MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images. He does have a known 70% stenosis in a non-dominant LCx, but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory. His ECG today is unchanged from priors. However, given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms. I will call the patient in several days time, and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT.\n2) Secondary prevention: Most recent Lipid panel in 10\/35 on Lipitor 20mg daily shows TC 126, LDL 62, HDL 25 and TGs 195. His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings. Given this, along with an elevated TG value, we will start Niaspan. He can start with 500 mg qhs for the first 2-3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects (i.e. flushing). He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 30 minutes before to help minimize side effects. After a few weeks, he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1000 mg qhs.\nHe has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward. He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level.\n3) Hypertension: Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily. He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure.\nChanges to Medications this visit Niaspan 500mg SR po at bedtime 2 tablets each night QTY:90 Refills:2 Start: 12\/15\/2135 Plavix 75mg po daily Start: 12\/16\/2134 End: 12\/19\/2135 - Inactivated ASA 81mg po daily Start: 12\/16\/2134\nDisposition: Return in 4-6 months or PRN\nJan Ivory, MD\ncc: ADDENDUM: I spoke with the patient on 12\/21 and his chest discomfort symptoms have resolved and he is feeling well in his usual activities.

He has occasional fleeting chest pain but never sustained and nothing in the past 1-2 months.\nHe awoke this AM with dull left chest pain which has persisted throughout the day. Pain was 6\/10 at worst, unchanged with exertion and similar in quality (albeit less intense) to pain during STEMI. No associated SOB, nausea, diaphoresis or radiation. Given the CP persistance, he presented to the ER. Initial ECGs showed sinus brady with a relatively normal tracing; no acute ischemic changes and no significant change from prior. After a combination of 4 SL nitro, IV nitro, IV heparin and morphine (2mg IV x 2), the CP eventually subsided.\nCurrently, he is CP free and resting comfortably. At baseline, he doesn't exercise formally but he has 3 flights of stairs at home and he's able to climb them without exertional symptoms. Also, he was previously on therapy for GERD but stopped taking prilosec several months ago.\nPast medical history: - CAD - as above - HTN - hyperlipidemia - DM2 - no known microvascular disease; last A1c 7.3 (June 36) - Ankylosing spondylitis - h\/o thrombophlebitis (vs DVT) of left leg - hemorrhoids s\/p banding\nHome meds: ASA 81, lipitor 20, metformin 500, zestril 10, toprol 25\n\nChanges to Allergies NKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]\nSocial history: Lives with wife in Avra Valley, KS.

On the last visit he was having chest pain and was therefore sent to the Emergency Room for a further evaluation. At that time he had EKGs which did not demonstrate any ischemia during his chest pain and a chest x-ray which was unremarkable. The Emergency Room physicians contacted his doctors at Humbert Hospital and obtained a history that the patient had a cardiomyopathy in the past with a decreased LV function. However repeat echo within the past months demonstrated good LV function and they were in the process of performing further cardiac testing when the patient left the Humbert Hospital against medical advice. After being evaluated in the Emergency Room at Pontiac State, he now returns to be tied in with the Internal Medicine clinic. Medications: His medications since his Emergency Room visit include Carafate 1 gm. PO q.i.d, Prinivil 10 mg. PO q.d, Tenormin 50 mg. PO q.d, Motrin 600 mg. t.i.d. p.r.n. and Nitrostat tablets p.r.n. His insulin dosing consists of 40 units of NPH q.a.m. and 18 units q.p.m. and regular insulin 20 units q.a.m. On return to my office today, he states that the frequency of his chest pain is much diminished but that he has gained some weight since discontinuing his Lasix per order of the Emergency Room physicians. Physical Exam: On exam, his blood pressure is 160\/100 with a heart rate of 76. He is not in any acute distress. His chest is clear to auscultation. His cardiac exam demonstrates S4 gallop and distant heart sounds. His abdominal exam is benign except for massive obesity. His rectal exam is guaiac negative. His extremities exam demonstrates 1+ pitting edema to the shins and his neurologic exam is unremarkable. Assessment and Plan: 1. Cardiac. The patient will be scheduled for an ETT thallium study to rule out ischemia. 2. Hypertension. His Prinivil will be increased to 20 mg. q.d. 3. Diabetes. His sugars have been running 130 to 160 by fingerstick checks at home and he will continue his present regimen. 4. The patient will be referred to ophthalmology for the evaluation of his eyes given his history of hypertension and diabetes. 5. General. The patient will see me shortly after completion of an ETT thallium study for further discussion of his cardiac status.

I have seen him on multiple occasions for his coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes. The patient has had a positive exercise tolerance test recently and was seen by Cardiology who felt that he should undergo cardiac catheterization. However, patient was overweight and the decision was made for him to reduce his weight by approximately 50 lb. at which time he would be suitable for cardiac catheterization on the Pontiac equipment. Patient was seen last night in the Pontiac Emergency Room with a several day history of back pain which began in the middle of his back and has subsequently become right flank pain which is persistent and colicky in nature. On exam in the Emergency Room he was noted to be afebrile. His exam was notable for CVA tenderness and an exam highly suspicious of renal colic. His EKG was unremarkable and his laboratory exam was unremarkable as well. His urinalysis did not demonstrate any red blood cells, however, did have 3+ uric acid crystals with a normal uric acid blood level. An abdominal ultrasound was ordered which was unremarkable except for the presence of his slight abnormality in the right pole of a kidney. IVP was recommended by the radiologist for follow-up. He was given Toradol in the Emergency Room with minimal improvement and sent home with some Motrin with the follow-up to be by me in Internal Medicine Clinic. I was called by the patient this morning complaining of worsening pain in his right flank. On it, patient states he is unable to get out of bed and was brought to the Pontiac State Hospital to my Internal Medicine Clinic. On exam he was afebrile and his exam was notable for a right CVA tenderness with pain radiating around to his abdomen and exacerbated by pushing on his abdomen. Patient has good bowel sounds throughout and there are no peritoneal signs. Assessment and Plan: While I am concerned about his possible renal pathology I believe that there is a significant chance that this may be musculoskeletal in nature, however, due to his other medical problems I feel that an intravenous pyelogram is definitely indicated and he will undergo this study this afternoon. I have also sent off a repeat CBC with differential, a repeat urinalysis and amylase and lipase levels to rule out pancreatitis. Of note, patient does have a history of peptic ulcer disease, however, he was guaiac negative in the Emergency Room and reports no episodes of hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena. He is also status post cholecystectomy. I will review his IVP later today and make further therapeutic interventions at that time.

She comes today bothered by right-sided shoulder pain. On a previous visit she had complained of this and I wanted to put her on Motrin but she wanted to try Tylenol. The pain bothers her sometimes at night and is throbbing. It bothers her when she tries to attach her bra behind her back. Other than that she has been doing fairly well. She has not had any chest pains. She has not had any symptoms of TIAs. She has a lot of concern about her chronic renal insufficiency and wants to discuss this. Medications: Lopressor. Hydochlorothiazide. Procardia XL. Micronase. Motrin. Aspirin. Allergies: Lisinopril causes hypokelemia. Family History: Non-contributory. Social History: She has a daughter, Rhodes, who has been very supportive. No cigarettes or alcohol. Review of Systems: She refuses general GYN screening. She had a hemoglobin A1C in March, which was 6.4. She had an ophthalmology exam in September. Physical Examination: Worried. Weight 131 lb. Blood pressure 142\/60. Pulse is 72.

No hepatomegaly. No splenomegaly. No pedal edema. Examination of the right shoulder shows that she has tenderness on abduction beyond 110 but her most marked tenderness is with her internal rotation and she is unable to do this further than L5. Procedure: The right subdeltoid bursa was prepped with Betadine. The skin was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine in a 27 gauge needle. The subdeltoid bursa itself was entered with a 21 gauge needle and a mixture of 1cc of 1% Xylocaine and 40mg of Depo-Medrol was injected. She tolerated the procedure well.

As you know, she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night. She has been taking quinine for this, however develops palpitations whenever she takes the quinine. She has not been taking this since the initial two doses. I suspect that her leg cramps are probably secondary to intermittent passing fluxes. I have told her to eat a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg cramps in the evening. In the meantime, her EKG showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 per minute. There is borderline first degree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchanged from previous tracing. We will continue her on Vasotec 10 mg bid as well as Lopressor 12.5 mg bid. She will see me in follow-up in three months' time. Again, thank you for referring this patient to my cardiovascular clinic. With warm regards. Sincerely, Gordon Q.

As you know, we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferior wall ischemia. I wasn't sure whether or not this ischemia was new. On review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes, she did not have her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass. Therefore, I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is probably old and was the result of the fact that they did not bypass this area. She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenous venous grafts to the circumflex territory, the OM and the diagonal. She has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and I recommended we continue her current cardiac medications. However, she has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have a history of otitis media in her right ear. Therefore, I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate her ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches. In the meantime, I have suggested that she take her nifedipine and nitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during these episodes. I suspect that her blood pressure rise during these episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problem with her cardiovascular system. She will return to see me in follow-up in three months time, at which time I will check her cholesterol level. Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient. Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions. With warm regards, Gordon Q.

After being on the dose\nof Procardia, she noticed some continuation of her symptoms and Dr. Iniguez\nsuggested that she increase the dose to two tablets daily. She has been\non that dose for the last two weeks and has noticed dramatic change in\nher symptoms. Shes having much fewer spells and her blood pressure,\nlikewise is much lower than it had been. Overall, she is pleased with\nthese results.\n\nHer other medications have remained the same although she has\ndiscontinued using immediate release Nifedipine and Nitroglycerin both\nsublingual and patches.\n\nBP initially 142\/52, later by me 170\/68\nWeight 155 lbs.\nPulse 68\nHer examination remains unchanged except she has 2+ edema in her left\nleg and 1+ in the right leg.\n\nAssessment: Labile hypertension-clinically improved.\n\nPlan:\n\n1.

As you know, Ms. Benitez has been having a\nterrible past month with increasing episodes of substernal chest\ndiscomfort. One episode occurred during Ramadan when she was\nfasting and another occurred while she was in a restaurant. Both of\nthese episodes were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerine. I\nam concerned about her discomfort because of an earlier\nPersantine MIBI study showing anteroapical redistribution on her\ntest and the fact that it was relieved by nitroglycerine.\nCurrently she denies any PND, orthopnea or chest discomfort. She\ncontinues to have back and bilateral hip pain and has been taking\ncorticosteroid shots for that.\n\nOn physical examination, she is an anxious, concerned, elderly\nwoman. Blood pressure is 160\/70 in the left arm. Jugular venous\npulse is not observed. She has bilateral carotid bruits. Chest\nexam is clear. Cardiac exam shows an S4 gallop, a normal S1, a\nphysiologically split S2 and a 2\/6 systolic murmur at the left\nsternal border. Abdominal exam is benign. Peripheral exam shows\ntrace pedal edema.\n\nEKG shows sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute.\nThere are Q waves in V1 through V4, consistent with an old\nanterolateral MI. The tracing was otherwise unchanged compared\nwith previous tracings.\nRE: BENITEZ, Wonda\nMRN: 892-76-95-4 - 2 - November 01, 2085\n\n\nIMPRESSION: I think we should schedule Ms. Benitez for a\nPersantine thallium test as soon as possible. If she can\nexercise on this test, that would be even better. When the\nresults are back, I will get back you regarding further\nrecommendations. My hope is that we will not have to\nrevascularize her again. If we do, I am hoping to do so with\npotential angioplasty and stenting. In the meantime, I have\nswitched her from Zocor 40 mg to Lipitor 40 mg a day in the hopes\nof targeting her LDL cholesterol to the new guidelines of 100.\nHer previous LDL cholesterol was 111. I also suggested to her in\nthe meantime to cut down on her physical activities until we know\nthe results of the thallium test and also to forgo one episode of\nher steroid injection for her back.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or concerns\nregarding this patient. Again, thank you for referring her to\nour clinic.\n\nWith warm regards,\n\n\n\nGordon Q.

She has been reasonably stable since\nI saw her last in July. She has had several episodes of chest\ndiscomfort characterized as a tightness which has been quite\ntransient. The frequency has been less than one time per month.\nThe last occurred yesterday while she was walking in a shopping\nmall. She continued to walk and her symptom resolved. She has\nnot had any associated shortness of breath or diaphoresis.\n\nShe has had no symptoms of cardiovascular ischemia, denying\ntransient hemiparesis, hemiparesthesia, or amaurosis fugax. She\ndenies claudication but does admit to back pain, bilateral hip\npain with walking. She still notes paresthesias of both feet.\nShe continues to be bothered by tinnitus as well as headaches.\n\nHer current medical regimen includes losartan 75 mg p.o. b.i.d,\nnifedipine XL 60 mg p.o. q.d, aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d,\natorvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d, metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d,\nSynthroid? 5 mcg five days per week and 10.5 mcg two days per\nweek, furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n, quinine sulfate 324 mg\np.o. h.s. (for cramping), nitroglycerin p.r.n, Zoloft 15 mg p.o.\nh.s, lorazepam 15 mg p.o. q.h.s, magnesium oxide 250 mg p.o.\nq.d. and Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. p.r.n.\n\nOn examination she appears well. Weight is 142 pounds. Blood\npressure is 140\/60. Heart rate is 50 and regular. Neck veins\nare 6 cm above the mid right atrium. There are bilateral carotid\nbruits. Lungs are resonant to percussion and clear to\nauscultation. On cardiac exam the PMI is in the fifth\nintercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is a 1+ left\nventricular lift. The first heart sound is normal. The second\n\nBenitez, Wonda MRN: 89276954\nNovember 07, 2086 -2-\n\n\nis split physiologically. There is a grade 2\/6 mid systolic\nmurmur at the apex and a grade 2\/6 systolic ejection murmur along\nthe left sternal border. There is a fourth heart sound at the\napex. Abdominal examination reveals no masses, no\nhepatosplenomegaly. Extremities are notable for 2+ bilateral\nfemoral pulses, palpable bilateral tibial artery bypass graft\npulses, absent bilateral popliteal pulses, 1+ right dorsalis\npedis, absent right posterior tibial and absent left pedal\npulses.\n\nHer electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia with first degree\nAV block and findings suggestive of a prior anterolateral\nmyocardial infarction. There has been no diagnostic change since\nJuly 18, 2086.\n\nCarotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on October 31,\n2086 showed a 55% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery\nand a 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. The\nvelocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequent\ncalculation of stenosis was less than it had been in February\n2086.\n\nGraft scans obtained on October 31, 2086 demonstrated patent left\nfemoral-anterior tibial artery bypass graft with increased\nvelocities consistent with a greater than 75% stenosis at the mid\nthigh level and this was increased from a study of August 06, 2086.\nThe right femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patent\nwith no evidence of significant stenoses.\n\nIn summary, her problems relevant to this visit include:\n\n1. Coronary artery disease. Status post coronary artery bypass\nsurgery. LIMA to the LAD and SVGs to the diagonal and\nposterolateral left ventricular branch. She has occasional and\nvery transient episodes of angina. I have suggested continuing\nher current medical regimen. As noted previously, I prefer to\nmanage her medically unless her symptoms worsen.\n\n2. Carotid artery disease. She is asymptomatic. I recommend\nperiodic surveillance with carotid ultrasound.\n\n3. Peripheral arterial disease. Both grafts are patent but the\nleft femoral-anterior bypass graft appears by ultrasound to have\na significant stenosis. I have asked her to discuss this finding\nwith you further.\n\nBenitez, Wonda MRN: 89276954\nNovember 07, 2086 -3-\n\n\n4. Hypercholesterolemia. A lipid profile will be checked today.\n\n\n5. Systolic murmur and query antibiotic prophylaxis for dental\nprocedures. I am evaluating her murmurs, which were presumably\naortic sclerosis and mitral regurgitation, with an\nechocardiogram.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nThomas Waller, M.D.\n\ncc:\nTerry W.

He was admitted on 07\/23\/2082, one month after previous admission for abdominal pain. In retrospect, that admission may have been related in part to GI symptoms of heart failure. He came in complaining of continued GI discomfort, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and 9 pounds of weight gain with increasing abdominal girth. His medications at the time of admission included beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for hypertension, with no diuretics.\n\nDuring his hospitalization, he underwent 7.5 kilograms of diuresis with resolution of his jugular venous pressure from approximately 25 cm to 8 cm. His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 20% with LV dimension of 5.1, enlarged right ventricle with mild decrease in RV function, but severe RV pressure overload with estimated PA pressure 80 plus the right atrial pressure. After he had his diuresis, he underwent right heart catheterization, which revealed a right atrial pressure of 8, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18, PA pressure of 65\/35. He underwent a trial with IV nitroglycerin, then with sildenafil. The IV nitroglycerin decreased his BLANK pressures only by approximately 8-10 mm but he noted a further improvement in his dyspnea. There was no clear improvement with the sildenafil in either his symptoms or hemodynamics. His cardiac output varied between 3.1 and 4.5 on all the medications. The decision was just to put him on oral nitroglycerin in addition to the other standard heart failure medications. He also underwent a MIBI looking for any evidence of active ischemia, which there was none.\n\nAt the time of discharge, he is walking easily without postural change or symptoms. His medications are Isordil 10 t.i.d, Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. He is on Toprol-XL 12.5 daily. His lisinopril was decreased from 40 mg to 20 mg, but should he have any problems with hypotension, this could certainly be decreased further to 10 or even 5 mg if necessary to allow him comfortable ambulation. He is on Plavix 75 mg daily as well and simvastatin 40. His discharge blood pressure is 102\/60, jugular venous pressure is 8-9 cm. His creatinine is 1.3 with a BUN of 44, hematocrit 40, white blood count 5000, potassium 3.9, sodium 139.\n\nIt has been my great pleasure to participate in his care. He is trying very hard to learn how to manage his disease at home, with the help of his family. We have emphasized not only the salt restriction but also a fluid restriction to 2 liters a day, which includes all fluids, We would encourage him to resume his daily exercise such as walking. He has an appointment to see Dr. Anderson on 08\/20\/2081, and is looking forward to returning to your care.\n\nI would be happy to answer any further questions about it.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nUrsula Michael Troyer, MD\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:3-8959007 IFFocus\n\nCC: Forrest T.

As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it briefly for our records. Mrs. Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history of coronary artery disease. After several catheterizations in the 2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease (done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in July of 2071 showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she was managed medically. However, she suffered a non-Q wave myocardial infarction on February of 2072 at which time she underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary artery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronary bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA, D1 and obtuse marginal branch. She underwent repeat catheterization in February of 2073 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology. She underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2074 because of a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60% proximal LAD stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch and a 70% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery. The saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch. The left intramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete stenoses. Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of posterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 60%. She therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center in early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft to her diagonal artery. She tolerated this uneventfully and was Olivier, Christine MR #652-33-21-5 -2- July 05, 2074 discharged and since then has not had significant exertional chest discomfort. Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild exertional dyspnea. She has undergone extensive pulmonary evaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which have revealed an FEV1 of 1.3 which is 59% predicted, and an FVC of 1.5 which is also 55% predicted giving her a pattern consistent with restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, she has a history of a seizure disorder, diabetes, hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy. Medications at present: NPH insulin 60 units sub q qAM, CZI insulin 30 units sub q qAM, NPH insulin 60 units sub q qPM, enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d, atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d, Captopril 25 mg po t.i.d, amlodipine 5 mg po q.d, simvastatin 10 mg po q.d, nitroglycerin prn, Nitropatch .2 mg for twelve hours of a twenty-four hour period, Neurontin 300 mg one tab po t.i.d, Trusopt one drop ou q.d, Alantin one drop ou q.h.s. and albuterol inhalers two puffs q.i.d. prn. Cigarettes - none at present. Physical exam reveals a well-nourished mildly overweight woman in no acute distress. Blood pressure right arm sitting 140\/70, heart rate 75 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 172 pounds. The neck is supple. JVP flat. Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits. Chest is clear with a trace right basilar rhonchi. Cardiac exam shows a normal S1, physiologically split S2 and a I-II\/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub. The abdomen is benign with bowel sounds well heard. Extremities without appreciable edema. Peripheral pulses are intact. There is 1+ bipedal edema. Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 75. PR interval of .14, QRS .08, QT .34, axis -20 degrees. There is evidence of a left atrial abnormality and poor R wave progression in leads V1 through V3. Impression: Mrs. Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with significant atherosclerosis, diabetes and now a chief complaint of modest exertional dyspnea and fatigue. She denies any active chest discomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at alleviating the chest pain syndrome. The records available to me indicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta blocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an exacerbation of her angina. However, now that she is status post her PTCA it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker reduction and therefore, I suggested she decrease her atenolol to 50 mg po q.d. She will have her blood pressure checked within the next several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic, I will Olivier, Christine MR #652-33-21-5 -3- July 05, 2074 also try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheral edema and in part because she may no longer need this. Otherwise, I have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except to encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she can and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in close contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur. I would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem appropriate.

Currently, she complains of mild exertional fatigue and rare exertional chest discomfort. In addition, she states that she has no energy and worries that her coronary artery pathology has returned. She reports occasionally taking sublingual nitroglycerin for chest discomfort but this is on an infrequent basis. She remains on a plethora of medications including NPH insulin 64 units sub q qAM along with 34 units CZI sub q qAM and 68 units NPH sub q qPM, enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d, Captopril 25 mg po t.i.d, Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d, simvastatin 10 mg po q.d, amlodipine 5 mg po q.d, Neurontin 900 mg po t.i.d, atenolol 50 mg po q.d, estrogen 0.05 topically q three days and a nitropatch .2 mg per twenty-four hours which she wears for twelve over twenty-four hour period. Physical exam reveals a well-nourished woman in no acute distress. Blood pressure right arm sitting 140\/80, heart rate 85 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 174 pounds. The neck is supple. JVP flat. Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits. Chest is completely clear. Cardiac exam shows a normal S1, physiologically split S2 and a I-II\/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub. The abdomen is benign. Extremities without appreciable edema. Peripheral pulses are intact. Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85. PR interval of .14, QRS .08, QT .32, axis -20 degrees. There are mild diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave changes as well as evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to her last electrocardiogram, her heart rate is slower and her ST-T wave changes are less prominent. Olivier, Christine MR #652-33-21-5 -2- December 05, 2074 Impression: Mrs. Olivier has currently recovered from her multi-lesion PTCA and stent placement therapy. Currently it is not clear to me that her symptoms are secondary to recurrent ischemia, however I will have her undergo an exercise tolerance test (adenosine MIBI) to help to further evaluate this. In addition, I will obtain routine blood studies including an glycosylated hemoglobin. It is certainly possible that her fatigue and generalized sense of lack of energy is from a non-cardiac cause. Pending review of these lab studies however, I have not altered her present regimen. She will contact you or myself should her chest pain syndrome at all progress in terms of severity or duration. Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT: The resident's note was reviewed, and the patient seen and examined on arrival. This is a 65-year-old female status post multiple angioplasties and stent placement. She had recurrence of her typical angina at home, took three nitroglycerin with minimal relief, and activated the 911 system. Her pre-hospital electrocardiogram shows a small amount of ST depression, perhaps 1 mm, and flattening V3-V6. This is comparable to a previous electrocardiogram in October, which may have been her most recent presentation with ischemia. She was given aspirin and nitroglycerin, and continued to have pain in the Emergency Department. The total duration of pain was approximately two hours. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her vital signs remained stable. LABORATORY EVALUATION: Her initial enzymes were flat. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: She is being taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for an urgent study to rule out acute coronary syndrome. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Rule out unstable angina. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): The patient is taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory. The condition at the time of this dictation is favorable.

Since last seen, she reports return in a non-exertional left shoulder discomfort syndrome, occasionally associated with mild dyspnea. Of note, she underwent a dobutamine MIBI stress test last June for evaluating a similar syndrome, and at that time she developed her typical chest and left back pain syndrome in association with no diagnostic EKG changes at a peak heart rate of 127, peak blood pressure of 160\/60. A simultaneously obtained SESTA MIBI scan revealed a global left ventricular fraction of 42%, a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction involving 2 out of 20 segments of the inferior wall and minimal peri-infarct ischemia. In addition, a venous duplex ultrasound study done to evaluate her severe left greater than right peripheral edema showed no evidence of DVT. Currently she remains on a regimen of amlodipine 5 mg poqd, atenolol 50 mg poqd, simvastatin 10 mg poqd, lisinopril 10 mg poqd, Nitropatch .4 mg q.12 hours, Neurontin 400 mg potid, furosemide 40 mg poqd (recently increased), Lamactil 150 mg pobid, Trusopt and Xalantan drops, insulin 10 units of CZI with 72 units NPH qam and 74 units NPH qpm. Physical exam reveals an overweight woman in no distress. Blood pressure, right arm sitting - 110\/70, heart rate - 70 and regular, respirations - 12 and unlabored, weight - 174 pounds which is four pounds below her weight of six months ago. The neck is supple with JVP flat. Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits. Chest is clear. Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2, and a I\/VI holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla. No significant diastolic murmur or rub. The abdomen is benign. Extremities reveal marked left greater than right pedal edema. Peripheral pulses are diminished. Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 70, PR interval of .12, QRS of .06, QT of .36, axis of -25. There is borderline Paul Arteaga, M.D. December 11, 2076 Page Two Re: Christine Olivier MR #652-33-21-5 evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST and T- wave changes. Compared with the last electrocardiogram, there has been no significant change. Presently, Mrs. Olivier has evidence of continuing chest and left shoulder discomfort which she believes is similar to her pre-bypass surgery angina. In this setting, a dobutamine stress test performed last June showed no evidence of provokable ischemia. I have spent some time discussing with Ms. Olivier our various therapeutic and diagnostic options. She made it quite clear that she would not consider repeat cardiac catheterization at this time, and furthermore, was very disinterested in pursuing the possibility (should she require it) of either mechanical or surgical re- vascularization. It is not entirely clear to me that her left shoulder syndrome is in fact ischemic in origin, and she certainly understands it may be secondary to musculoskeletal abnormalities. I have suggested that she discuss that further with you. In the meantime, I have asked her (as her back and chest discomfort syndrome appears to occur mostly at night prior to lying down for bed) to apply her Nitropatch in the evening and take it off in the morning. She will call me within the next several days to report how this helps her discomfort syndrome. I do not believe that she is having GERD to explain her symptoms. In light of her reluctance to undergo any further diagnostic cardiac studies, I will try to tailor her anti-ischemic medications to minimize her chest discomfort syndrome. I, of course, will keep you fully informed as to her progress, and I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care.

Xayachack, M.D. 039 Will St Vicente, Kadeem Sandpoint, MI 58543 CK759182 (033) 250-1408 12-27-92 HPI: Kadeem Vicente comes in today for a follow-up office visit. The patient was seen by me approximately one month ago as a new patient and whose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease, for which he suffered a silent heart attack many years ago, a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy, as well as hypertension and GERD. As it turns out, the patient had been on Zantac for many, many years, the beneficial effects of which were unknown. We had decided as of our last meeting to stop this drug and find out if he became symptomatic. The patient reports today that he is not symptomatic, and thus we will continue to discontinue this medicine. At this point, the patient does not need the addition of a proton pump inhibitor, such as Prilosec. With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, the patient said that he only has taken one dose of the Hytrin, since he wanted to use up all his Minipress, which he tool up until 2 nights ago. Thus it is too early to assess the efficacy of this medication. It is noted that his blood pressure was 152\/74, which is better than it was the last time he was here, which the systolic range was 160-170 and diastolic was 80-90. The patient reports no new symptomatology other than occasional fatigue, from which he will have to rest. The patient has no symptoms of congestive heart failure, no shortness of breath, no ankle edema, no JVD by observation, and his laboratory results are remarkably normal, given his medical complaints. The patient's cholesterol is 190 with a slightly above average triglycerides. Review of systems otherwise negative. Physical exam is not performed at this time. Blood pressure was 152\/76 on the right, 152\/76 on the left, temperature was 96.8, respirations 20 and unlabored, and pulse was 70. ASSESSMENT\/PLAN: This is a 75 year old man with multiple medical problems coming in for follow-up. 1. Hypertension - the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use Hytrin now, both for his hypertension, as well as benign prostatic hypertrophy. The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling, and he said he also has urge incontinence, particularly while standing. The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin, which hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, that this urge incontinency will also be helped. If the patient's symptoms continue beyond this, he will be referred to Urology for possible TUNA procedure. 2. BPH - please see above. The patient will stay on Hytrin for now. 3? coronary artery disease - the patient's cholesterol is 190 with a slightly above average triglycerides, which is more than acceptable for this gentleman. I do not have an HDL in which to judge his ratio, but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high 40s MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL Stephen A.N.

I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in about 6 months, and if there is any derangement in his profile, he will be put on an antilipid drug. 4. GI - at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned, and what I will attempt to do is to keep him off his H2 blockers at this point. Should his symptoms return, the patient most likely will be placed on Prilosec. I will seen him in one month for follow-up, primarily for evaluation of his use of Hytrin. Stephen A.N.

The patient is seen primarily for follow up regarding his history of hypertension, coronary artery disease (the patient is status post inferior wall MI), benign prostatic hypertrophy and to a much lesser extent osteoarthritis. The patient is also followed GERD-like symptoms. With regard to the latter, the patient notes that since he has been off the Zantac, he initially saw no change in his ability to handle foods; however, he now notes that he is starting to get some reflux and feels slightly uncomfortable with this. He denies chest pain per se and any symptoms pertinent to cardiovascular disease, such as chest heaviness, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea. The patient knows the foods that give him this type of reaction, such as tomato based sauces and tries to avoid them as much as possible. The patient is asking me about Prilosec which he recently read in the Journal and was wandering whether this would be a suitable alternative to H2 blockers (Patient had been on H2 blockers for many years without a trial off of them, which a reason that we stopped his H2 blocker therapy recently). With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, the patient says that these have almost completely resolved on the 4 mg of Hytrin and which he will continue taking. The patient does remain on Zestril for his hypertension as well as the Hytrin and the blood pressure gotten by the nurse today was 150\/80 and repeated by me 20 minutes later was 130\/74. The patient reports being otherwise well, no new symptoms. No positive review of systems. PHYSICAL EXAM: Was not performed. Vitals: Blood pressure taken by me was 130\/74 in the right, 130\/74 in the left, temperature was 98.8, respirations 20, unlabored and pulse was 80. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75 year old man with multiple medical concerns comes in for follow up. 1. Hypertension. The patient will stay on his Zestril, once a day as well as his Hytrin, which he uses also for BPH. His blood pressure appears to be well controlled on this regimen. One of the issues would be whether or not the patient should be on a beta-blocker. The patient verbally has a history of a silent heart attack and there is evidence of an inferior wall MI and this is certainly an option we will consider in the future, although I would not add a third anti-hypertensive regimen and would most likely replace his Zestril with a beta-blocker. 2. GERD. The patient will be given a prescription for Prilosec 20 mg to be taken at bedtime. The patient was told that this would not MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL Stephen A.N.

The patient does have a known hiatal hernia, which may also contribute to his symptoms of chronic reflux. 3. BPH - The patient will stay on his 4 mg of Hytrin, which appears to be working quite well. The patient notes that there is less dribbling, less nocturnal urination. The patient does take Lasix 20 mg once a day for congestive heart failure and did not have any difficulty with urination after he takes the diuretic. 4. Insomnia. The patient will stay on his Ambien 10 mg which he takes on a q.h.s. basis. The patient was formerly on Amitriptyline but was told that the secondary side effects which can include EKG changes and at this point tells me that the Ambien works and he would like to stay on this. Patient has enough to last until I see him next time. I will thus see the patient in 3 months for a fasting lipid (The patient's lipid profile thus far has been acceptable. The cholesterol is 190 and an acceptable triglyceride; however, I do want to assess the patient's LDL and HDL before making any decisions with regard to treatment. Stephen A.N.

He has remained on digoxin status post his myocardial infarction. We want to recheck his cholesterol today. We also have been concerned that he has been a little depressed but mostly because he is concerned about his wife's situation with breast cancer. We had a long discussion about this. Physical Examination: On physical examination, his weight is 250 lbs. His blood pressure was 178\/80. The follow-up was 170\/80. His neck was supple. Chest was clear to both percussion and auscultation. Cardiac exam was regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs. Abdomen was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities were clear of cyanosis, clubbing or edema. Rectal tone was normal and guaiac negative. Laboratory Data: His hematocrit was 39.9. Platelets were within normal limits. White count is 8.3. Digoxin is 0.9. Lytes are within normal limits. Assessment and Plan: 1. Status post TURP. He appears to be recovering well. He has had slight incontinence, but I suspect this will pass. 2. Thrombocytopenia. This was very relative. It now appears to have resolved. 3. Coronary artery disease. As he recovers from his TURP, I question whether it might be reasonable to go ahead and reexercise him. At the present time, he is quite stable on an aspirin, digoxin and Lasix. However, it may be that he would benefit from further treatment with anti-anginals. 4. Hypercholesterolemia. This has been well-controlled recently. His last cholesterol was 168 in August of 2093. 5. Depression. He continues on Ambien. He has some discretion about his wife's breast cancer, and he appears to have some of his uncertainty resolved.

MRN: 948-59-58-0 Dear Miles: I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Vicente in Cardiovascular Care today. This lovely 77-year old man has had past medical history notable for coronary artery disease, hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, depression, insomnia, osteoarthritis status post total knee replacement. He presents today because of a recent exacerbation of symptomatic coronary artery disease. His history of coronary artery disease begins with his presentation following his total knee replacement in June of 2091. In 10\/91 he had an episode of profound weakness and sat down. He had no clear substernal chest pressure, loss of consciousness or edema. Workup at that time included a thallium test which did not clearly demonstrate ischemia and an echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 50%. He began therapy at that point in time with aspirin, niacin, vitamin E, Lasix, Zestril, Zantac, Minipress, Amitriptyline, and Digoxin. He had been free of exertional neck, chest, arm and jaw pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, claudication and TIA until this past spring. He actually had done very well with risk factor reduction including completing cardiac rehab at MJH and following a stringent weight reduction program and decreasing his weight. In March of 2094 he began noticing that when he was going up the 19 steps in his house he began having mid-sternal chest discomfort and some dyspnea at the top of the stairs. He stopped working with the physiotherapist at that point and was initiated on nitrate therapy. Since that time he has noted that he has had significant decrease in symptoms and over the past week has actually had no need to take sublingual nitroglycerine and has been taking the full flight of stairs without difficulty. He does note fatigue and insomnia such that he is sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a night. He does continue to be free of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations or lightheadedness. Medical regimen includes Ambien, Paxil, Isordil 20 t.i.d, Atenolol, Digoxin, Zantac and aspirin. He has no known drug allergies. On physical exam blood pressure when he first arrived at Clinic was noted to be 220\/100. At the present time it is 180\/100 with a Vicente, Kadeem F. MRN: 948-59-58-0 June 12, 2094 Page Two heart rate of 55 and a respiratory rate of 10. There is no increase in jugular venous pressure. His carotids are free of bruits. His lungs are entirely clear to auscultation throughout, and cardiac exam is notable for a non-displaced PMI, S1 and physiologically-split S2 with no murmur, rub or gallop. Abdominal exam is notable for a ventral hernia. There is no organomegaly and neither are there bruits present. Lower extremities are notable for 2+ femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses with no edema. Skin exam is notable only for the senile angioma. Electrocardiogram is notable for a left bundle branch block which is new since prior tracing available here of 4\/03\/94. MIBI was notable only for a potential fixed anteroseptal defect and no significant ischemia on 5\/6\/94. The ejection fraction on a gated spect was 57%. In summary, it appears that Mr. Vicente may have experienced a new myocardial infarction resulting in a left bundle branch block in March of 2094. He could, however, also have developed his progressive conduction system disease and have the fixed defect on his MIBI attributable only to a left bundle branch block. I will be reviewing the primary images to make my final decision. In either regard he is now free of symptoms on his current medical regimen despite his increased weight and his increased blood pressure. I certainly agree with further assistance from nutrition and weight loss and proceeding with Imdur therapy which I would increase to 60 mg p.o. q.d. I also would consider further decrease of his LDL with statin therapy but would only consider this after assessing his response to re-initiation his nutrition program. Given his lack of symptoms at the present time with his usual daily activity, I would prefer to proceed on the medical therapy route. I think that he could be reintroduced to rehab at MJH with the hopes that further education can get him back on line in terms of risk factor reduction. I certainly look forward to discussing this case further with you. It's certainly a pleasure to participate in his care. Sincerely, Gwen K.

He finally took nitroglycerin\ntablets at about 9 or 10:00 a.m. and this abated his chest\ndiscomfort. The patient has known history of coronary artery\ndisease and recently had gone back on his coronary rehab program,\nhowever, yesterday after a workout, he became extremely tired, more\ntire than usual. He thought he might have pushed it a bit and he\nrested throughout the rest of the day. Then last night, he had\nsome chest discomfort, which he initially did not think much of.\nThen was then associated with some shortness of breath in the early\nmorning hours. He felt he was wheezing. This resolved after he\ngot up and walked around. He took the nitroglycerin tablets this\nmorning. These were fresh nitroglycerin tablets he had just\nobtained and this, in fact, resolved his symptoms. He then came in\nto see Dr. Echeverria, his physician, in clinic and was sent to the\nemergency department for evaluation. Please see the handwritten\nemergency department record for additional details.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease\nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY: See handwritten emergency\ndepartment record.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is presently comfortable, not\ntachypneic. His blood pressure is 160\/80. His heart rate is in\nthe 50s. There is no evidence of congestive heart failure on\nexamination. There is no jugular venous distention and his lungs\nare clear to auscultation. His heart examination is distant, with\nno murmurs or gallops appreciated. His extremities have trace\nedema. Abdomen in soft and non-tender. Pulses are equal.\nLABORATORY EVALUATION: His electrocardiogram shows a left bundle\nbranch pattern with no change in configuration from previous\ntracings. His other laboratory studies are pending.\nTHERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: The case was discussed with his\nphysician, Dr. Echeverria. We both agree that the patient has\nprobably had a progression of his coronary syndrome with possible\nunstable plaque, given his episode of shortness of breath and\nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. It is possible that he has silent\nischemia, which is not evident because of the left bundle branch\npattern. Pending the other evaluation and studies, which are being\nsent at this time, the patient will require hospitalization for\nfurther medical management.\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: Acute coronary insufficiency, coronary artery\ndisease.\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): The patient was\nadmitted to the hospital in stable condition.\nBR445\/05178\nSTEPHEN HENDERSON, M.D. SH44 D:09\/30\/95\nT:09\/30\/95\nDictated by: STEPHEN HENDERSON, M.D. SH44\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2170-02-17\n\nReason for Visit: chemotherapy\nDiagnosis\/Treatment Summary: 10\/16\/69 EGD @ Griffin Hospital: long partially-obstructing distal esophageal well differentiated invasive adenoCa, from 34-39 cm from Barrett's.

We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day. He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Osteoporosis. 2. Hypogonadism. 3. History of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy in 2169, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 5. Hypertension. 6. Diabetes type 2. 7. Carotid artery disease, left. 8. Hypercholesterolemia. 9. Status post AAA repair in 2165. 10. Coronary artery disease with status post stent.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He is anxious because he has some swallowing problems and fears that his esophageal disease is acting up and he is anticipating a CAT scan in a few days.\nMEDICATIONS: Tricor, metoprolol, Prilosec, Lipitor, aspirin, Plavix, Isordil, Zoloft, vitamin C, Centrum Caltrate plus D 600 mg twice a day, zoledronic acid 4 mg IV once a year and AndroGel 5 grams once a day.\nALLERGIES: Tape.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and has 3 children.\nVital signs: Blood pressure 118\/48, pulse 68, weight 136 pounds. Height 5 feet 4 inches.\nLABORATORY EVALUATION: His testosterone level on AndroGel is normal at 292 mg\/dL (normal 195-1138) on 09\/13\/2171. His hematocrit is 39. It was 37 in 02\/2171. Platelets are 179,000. White count 4.8.\nIn summary, Mr. Heath is a 76-year-old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer. The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy. I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism.\nHe will continue the current treatment with calcium, vitamin D, testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid. We will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\nYours sincerely,\n\n\nVincent Voorhees, M.D.\n\n\ncc: Quinten Heath, 976 Clinton Street, Gardnerville Ranchos, GA 79269 Dr. Quebedeaux Dr. Hendricks\nDD: 09\/20\/2171 TD: 09\/21\/2171 16:37:30 TR: 8190465 BackJob ID: 326372 VoiceJob ID: 91587262\n\n\n* Record date: 2173-02-04\nRADIATION ONCOLOGY FOLLOW-UP NOTE\nHEATH, QUINTEN M. 805-94-75\nREFERRING PHYSICIAN: Fred Quebedeaux, M.D.\nDATE OF VISIT: 2\/4\/2173\nREASON FOR VISIT: Reassessment of progress, s\/p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma, T2N1 stage IIB, s\/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (12\/01\/69) with pathologic tumor stage T2N1M0 (3\/23 involved lymph nodes).\nPOSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY: For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes, he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy. He was treated with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using IMRT, planned with 4D CT simulation. This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between March 29, 2170, and Apr 30, 2170.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quinten Heath is a 77 year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, chronic GERD, HTN, CAD s\/p PCI, partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x 2. He was in his USOH until 8\/69 when he began to have difficulty swallowing. While eating a hamburger he felt it lodge in his chest with accompanying retrosternal discomfort and increased salivation. He has had about a dozen similar episodes since then, which have generally resolved within 10-15 minutes without regurgitation. In 9\/69 his PCP prescribed a PPI, which helped somewhat, but he continued to have dysphagia. On 10\/16\/69 EGD at Griffin Hospital demonstrated a partially-obstructing distal esophageal mass 34-39 cm from the incisors, associated with Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. On 10\/17\/69 CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus. On 10\/21\/69 repeat CT of the chest showed an 8 mm LLL nodule and R-sided pleural thickening. Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35-40 cm with 9 mm thickness, suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria, one suspicious mediastinal LN, and porta hepatis adenopathy. On 10\/22 FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative.\nHe underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on 12\/1\/69. Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x0.8 cm, invading into muscularis propria (pT2) and metastasis to 3 of 27 LN (N1).\nINTERVAL HISTORY\/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms. He has maintained steady energy and appetite. He has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat. Otherwise, he has been doing well. He denies significant respiratory symptoms. No focal or generalized neurological symptoms.

He was golfing at the time, and suddenly developed weakness with no sensory changes. The weakness involved the face, arm and leg on the left side only. He went to Gilmore Hospital, where they checked his blood pressure, and found it to be 220\/140 (per his report). A CT scan was performed, and he was informed that it was normal. He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA. He went to the HCH at Easton 2 days later, his BP was still elevated, and they started him on clonidine. They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension, but he declined. No further stroke\/TIA workup was performed.\n\nHe comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup. His weakness has greatly improved, but not back to normal. He has never had sensory changes, and no speech difficulties, anosognosia, neglect, or gait instability. He did have flashing lights in both eyes for fifteen minutes at the onset of the symptoms on the golf course, but none since then. He has never had transient monocular blindness, diplopia, or suddenly blurry vision.\n\nPast Medical History\nHypertension.\nHe is being worked up for possible renal artery stenosis.\nHe has not had his cholesterol checked.\n\nMedications\nPROPRANOLOL (PROPRANOLOL HCL) 40MG PO BID Start Date: 10\/1\/32\nHCTZ (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) 12.5MG PO QD Start Date: 10\/1\/32\nCLONIDINE HCL 0.2MG PO BID Start Date: 10\/1\/32\nZESTRIL (LISINOPRIL) 40MG PO QD Start Date: 10\/1\/32\nASA (ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID) 81MG PO QD Start Date: 10\/1\/32\n\nAllergies\nNKDA\n\nSocial History\nlives in Avenal.

I have counseled him that most likely the best treatment for this type of stroke is to control his hypertension, and to use antiplatelet agents. I have asked that he increase his dose of ASA to 325 mg per day.\n\nIn addition, he needs a work up. I have arranged for him to have CNIS, 24 hour Holter monitoring, and TTE with bubble study. Additionally, we should check fasting lipids.\n\nHe wishes to have a PCP at FPC, and I have requested that he have the next available appointment with Dr. Harry Tolliver of the cardiology department, who could also be instrumental in adjusting his hypertension meds.\n\nHe will return to clinic in 2-3 months, and is to page me immediately with any new symptoms or concerns.\n\nCC\nDr. Harry Tolliver, FPC cardiology unit.\n\n\n* Record date: 2132-12-31\nPersonal Data and Overall Health\n75-year-old S\/P L internal capsule stroke 6\/32.\n\nReason for Visit\nMr. Slater returns to clinic today for routine follow up. I last saw him on 10\/1\/2132, and he has continued to improvesince that time. He remains on ASA 325mg po qd for stroke prevention, and continues to be worked up for renovascular hypertension. He has had no new stroke-like symptoms, and only very infrequently feels that the right leg is weak, usually at the end of the day when he is fatigued. He was recently seen by Dr. Harry Tolliver of the department of Cardiology. He underwent a 24-hour holter monitor, which showed no evidence for atrial fibrillation or other significant dysrhythmia. His CNIS have no evidence for disease. He is to go for his TTE with bubble study later today.\n\nMedications\nPROPRANOLOL (PROPRANOLOL HCL) 40MG PO BID x 87 days Start Date: 10\/1\/32 Stop Date: 12\/27\/32\nATENOLOL 50MG 1 Tablet(s) PO QD Start Date: 12\/31\/32\nNORVASC (AMLODIPINE) 2.5MG 1 Tablet(s) PO QD Start Date: 12\/31\/32\n\nExam\nAlert, Ox3.

ZIRKLE, MD\nATTENDING CONSULTATION NOTE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent renal cell carcinoma. HISTORY: Mr. Slater is a delightful and active 80-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a renal mass in 2133. At that time Dr. Updike performed a left partial nephrectomy, and the final pathology showed a 1.5 cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Since that date he has remained well with no clinical evidence of recurrent disease and has had interval CT scans. For the last 2 years, enhancing nodules have been noted within the region of the partial nephrectomy. A biopsy performed approximately 1 year ago did not demonstrate any cancer within modestly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. CT scan was repeated in December of 2137. This again showed some enlarged retroperitoneal adenopathy and also enlargement of the soft tissue nodules. Biopsy in March of this year showed probable recurrent renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type within the nodules. Biopsy of an adjacent adrenal gland showed no cancer. His metastatic workup has included CT scans of the chest, which have demonstrated small pulmonary nodules of uncertain significance. He has met with Drs. Eagle and Yzaguirre. Both have recommended completion of the nephrectomy and resection of any visible tumor, perhaps with intraoperative radiation as well. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension. 2. CVA with residual weakness on the right side. He is, however, still able to walk with a cane. 3. High cholesterol. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, Norvasc, Avapro, clonidine, Lipitor, and allopurinol.\nDRUG ALLERGIES: None known. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a long retired news writer with a heavy smoking history. He last smoked in 2132. He is a widow and came today to the appointment with 1 of his daughters. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No respiratory symptoms suggesting progressive pulmonary metastases, no abdominal or GI symptoms.\nPHYSICAL EXAM: No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing No gynecomastia Respiration comfortable Mild right-sided motor weakness, walks with a cane. No skeletal deformity or tenderness Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses. No hernias. RADIOLOGY: CT scans demonstrate multiple soft tissue nodules within the partial nephrectomy bed, the largest being 15 mm across. He also has prominent lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum, the largest of which is 14 mm, and an enlarged left common iliac lymph node of 18 mm. Chest CT shows scattered 2 mm nodules of uncertain significance. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Confirmed local recurrence of renal cell cancer - for completion nephrectomy and resection of tumor bed. Lymph nodes will be also be sampled. For intraoperative radiation if appropriate and possibly adjuvant radiation to follow. Consent obtained today. URIEL T.

His dermatologist started prednisone (60 mg daily) three weeks ago for a pemphigiod flair. Mr Slater&#8217;s sugars were initially well controlled off insulin, but a week and a half ago he began to develop lower extremity edema, DOE, and general fatigue. He began to taper the prednisone (to 40 mg daily) and then stopped them altogether yesterday. He presented to the FPC ED complaining of fatigue and weakness and was found to have a FSBG>500. His initial labs were notable for a glucose of 804. An EKG showed a-fib (rate 70s). His blood pressure, oxygenation, and respiratory were the normal range and he was given 2 L of NS and regular insulin. Repeat labs showed Glu 479 w\/ partial resolution of other electrolyte abnormalities. He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management.\nOn arrival to the floor, he reports feeling tired, but that his weakness and fatigue have improved since he arrived in the ED. He continues to have LE edema, which has worsened in the last day. He denies recent weight loss, fevers, cough, dyspnea or PND, syncope, N\/V, diarrhea, constipation, melena, urinary symptoms, joint pain, bruising, worsening rash, skin lesions, double vision, dysarthria, headache, or focal weakness or numbness.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n&#183; Bullous pemphigoid 2\/2 simvastatin\n&#183; Chronic kidney disease\n&#183; RAS\n&#183; History of CVA with residual minor weakness and numbness on the right side &#8216;00\n&#183; Hypertension\n&#183; Hypercholesterolemia\n&#183; PVD (ABI 0.43\/0.20 after exercise)\n&#183; AAA 2.8 cm &#8216;06\n\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\n&#183;\nStage III renal cell carcinoma status post L nephrectomy in 2133, now w\/ metastatic disease (+ retroperitoneal LN 8\/41)\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\nAmlodipine 5 mg PO daily\nAllopurinol 200 mg daily\nASA 325 daily\nDoxazosin 2 mg qHS\nHCTZ 12.5 PO daily\nAliskiren\/HCTZ 12.5 mg daily\nClonidine 0.2 mg PO BID\n\n\nALLERGIES: simvastatin (pemphigoid); ezetimibe (rash)\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Retired political journalist. 60 pk year smoking history, but none currently.

Galvan, M.D. Saint John River District Hospital 699 Kingston Drive Caro, MO 12151\nREFERRING PHYSICIAN: Richard L. Mckenzie, M.D. San Luis Obispo County General Hospital 123 Pittsburg Street, Euite 598 Baxter Springs, MO 64715\nHISTORY: Mr. Ehlers is referred for evaluation of extensive coronary disease status. He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking. He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm. He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\nHe is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia. He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest. He has not had any rest pain. For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta. He then had a left brachial artery. Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory. There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear. With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation. He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol. He is married and lives in Missouri.\nMEDICATIONS: His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A well-appearing man in no acute distress. Blood pressure of 128\/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%. He had no jugular venous distention. Chest was clear. Heart had normal S1 and S2. No S3 or S4. There is a 2\/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border. His abdomen was benign. Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.\nIMAGING STUDIES: His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable. His labs showed a BUN\/creatinine of 21\/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.\nIMPRESSION: Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease. We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease. We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve. We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.\nEdward L Echevarria, M.D.\n\n\neScription document:1-0864568 SFFocus\n\nDD: 10\/20\/97 DT: 10\/20\/97 DV: 10\/20\/97\n\n* Record date: 2097-11-06\n\nHistory of Present Illness\nAsked by Dr. Ehlers to consult on glycemic management for Mr. Ulysses Ehlers who has no history of DM but was noted to be hyperglycemic postop.

Initially presented to Bonner General Hospital 9\/97 for w\/u of exertional chest pain. Cardiac cath was unsuccessful via femoral approach due to presumed aortoiliac occlusion. Subsequent cath 10\/18\/97 revealed left main stenosis with distal occlusion, RCA proximal occlusion and diffuse LAD stenosis. Pt was transferred to BHCC on 10\/19 for further evaluation by the cardiology service. On 10\/21 he underwent echo which revealed EF 55% with mild AS. On 10\/22, cardiac cath revealed 3 V disease. Cardiac surgery was consulted and recommended CABG after medical optimization. His anginal symptoms remained stable and he was subsequently discharged home on 10\/23. He now returns for surgical revascularization. Since his discharge on 10\/23, he has not experienced any new or worsening chest pain or SOB. Denies orthopnea, PND.\n\nPreoperative Cardiac Status: Myocardial infarction 2084, requiring hospitalization. Myocardial infarction 2084, requiring hospitalization.

Creat rose from 1.6 (Nov 97) to 4.07 (may 98)\nHistory of Present Illness: This is a 69 year old male with a hx of CAD s\/p CABG 10\/2097, who was referred on 6\/03 from renal Dr. Turk, Elvis at the Central Buffalo Hospital to Dr. Judge at BHCC for rapidly progressive renal impairment. He is an arteriopath with occluded aorta beneath the levels of renal arteries as revealed in recent MRA. In the past an attempted femoral artery cannulation was proved unsuccessful due to above reason. Subsequently he underwent two cardiac angiograms thro' left brachial and Rt radial arterial route.\nHis creatinine has risen from baseline of 1.6 (Nov 97, post CABG) to 4.07 (may 98). He denies taking any NSAIDS. He thinks that he was started on Altace post surgery, but was not sure about that fact.\nDr. Turk did an duplex scan to assess his renal arteries which was suggestive of high grade stenosis of renal arteries on both sides. Since IR doctors at CentralBuffalo were not keen to do renal agniogram\/angioplasty thro' radial artery route, Dr.Turk refered Mr. Ehlers to BHCC for consideration of renal angioplasty. He has also asked him to discontinue Altace and to withold coumadin (Indn: AF) inview of potential angioplasty.\nHe complains of claudication pains in both legs with left leg>Rt leg. He experiences pain on exertion on left calf, thigh and buttock. He complains of long term pedal swelling which extends upto upper knee level. He is SOB on moderate exertion and sleeps with 3 pillows. He also has some prostatic symptoms with poor urinary stream, frequency etc.\nPast Medical History: CAD s\/p CABG on 10\/97 Paroxysmal AF DM2 HTN Hyperlipidemia PVD (occluded aorta) AS (aortic bicapsid) BPH\nMedications: NKDA Amiodarone 200mg daily Atenolol 100mg BID Metformin HCL 500mg daily ASA 81mg daily Lasix 40mg daily, lipitor 40mg daily prn Zetia 10mg daily prn\nFamily History: no history of renal disease in family\nSocial History: married.

His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr.Quilici, BHCC IR department. Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys. Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys. Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery. Both kidneys appeared normal in size 11.2 and 11.4 cm. Dr.Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.\n2. We have requested Dr.Xi, Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future. If so, whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys. We are awaiting his expert opinion.\n3. Patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro' radial artery carries its own risk. Risks of Cholesterol emboli, Contrast nephropathy, arterial injury, risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained. However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.\n4. We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.\n5. If patient is going for IR renal angiogram\/plasty, then he will need Contrast prophylaxis.\nWe will review him tomorrow with Dr.Xi's opinon.\nDONNIE YOUNGMAN MB MRCP(ENG) P43903\n\nRenal Staff\nI have seen and examined the patient twice today, and have reviewed his MR studies with radiology In essence I agree with Dr Youngman's recs.\nPatient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes. He has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia, mod severe bilateral claudication in LL. His renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.\nHis options are: 1) conservative approach, and likely ESRD in the coming weeks 2) Radiological placements of bilateral stents via L brachial artery 3) Surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for LL claudication\nWe are in discussions with Radiology and Surgery to come up with a final recommendation which we will d\/w patient tomorrow.\nUriah Judge MD PhD\n\n* Record date: 2098-06-11\n\nCardiovascular Medicine Consult Service Consult Note X. R. Xi, MD, PhD Vascular Medicine Fellow, #45811\nDate of Consultation: June 11, 2098\nID: 70 year old male from Missouri Reason for Consult: Perioperative consultation prior to aorto-bifemoral bypass surgery\nHistory of Present Illness: This 70 year old gentleman was diagnosed with an occluded distal aorta in mid-2097 after an attempt at cardiac catheterization via the femoral artery. Over the last several months, he has had exercise limiting lower extremity pain he describes primarily left leg burning (thigh, calf) when he walks, coming on over about 150 yards. If he pushes further, he will also get right leg burning in a similar distribution. He also has had a marked increase in CR over the past 8 monts (1.1 -> >4). Based on non-invasive imaging, this has been attributed to renal artery stenosis. His ACE-I (?ramipril) has been held, without improvement. A referral was recently made to rule out bilateral RAS, and he had an invasive aortogram yesterday. There was an 85% proximal right RA stenosis, and a 40% left RA stenosis, perhaps only partially explaining the elevated Cr. The angiogram also confirmed the occluded distal aorta (below the renal arteries, the SMA is patent). An aortobifem plus right RA revascularization is planned. He has had reduced functional capacity for some time. He gets claudication within 150 yards, but he also has been limited by exertional dyspnea. He complains also of orthopnea (3 pillows), PND, as well as bilateral LE edema. He also has noticed his weight continuing to creep up which he attributes to fluid retention. He is avoiding salt, but not fluid restricting. His lasix dose has not changed. He has been angina free since his CABG surgery. He has not had palpitations or AF since the immediate post-op period. A ROS is otherwise unremarkable.\nPast Medical History: Coronary artery disease MI 2084 Developed limiting angina in late 2096, early 2097 CABGx4 on November 05, 2097 (Dr. Ehlers) CABG x 4 (LIMA - LAD\/ Sequential graft: SVG1 connects Aorta to D1 then OM1\/ SVG2 - LVB2 Incidental anomalous circumflex off the right coronary artery Pre-op EF 50-55% with infero-posterior hypokineses (?post-op) Bicuspid aortic valve (not replaced with CABG according to notes) Mild AS, Mild AI only on pre-CABG echo 2097 Hypertension Dyslipidemia Diabetes Type II Perioperative hyperglycemia post CABG Exsmoker Quit 2097, >50 pack years Peripheral arterial disease Occluded distal aorta (diagnosed after cardiac catheterization attempt in 2097) Small infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm 3.6cm Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (x2 years at least) On coumadin for stroke prevention and amiodarone from maintenance of NSR Currently in NSR BPH Chronic back pain Renal insufficiency (Creatinine 4.1) non-oliguric - ?cause Cr normal November 2097 Gradually increased over November from 1.1-1.6, ang then was ~4 when recently checked Attributed to Renal artery stenosis based on non-invasive imaging (duplex, MRI), though Right inguinal hernia repair\nDenies VTE, denies pulmonary problems.\nCurrent Medications: ECASA 81 mg daily Amiodarone 200 mg daily atenolol 75 mg bid colace 100 mg bid heparin 5000 units sc q8h insulin sliding scale q4h simvastatin 40 mg at HS ezetimibe 10 mg daily albuterol\/ipratropium 3\/0.5 mg via neb q4h\nMedications at Home: Amiodarone 200mg daily Atenolol 100mg BID Metformin HCL 500mg daily ASA 81mg daily Lasix 40mg daily, lipitor 40mg daily prn Zetia 10mg daily prn Coumadin 5mg qd\nAllergies: Flecainide (arrhythmia).\nFamily History: Noncontributory.\nSocial History: Married, lives at home with his wife.

The issues include: Congestive heart failure I suspect there is worsening fluid retention primarily due to his worsening renal function. I would consider: increasing his diuretic (eg. Lasix 80 mg iv bid) to improve diuresis and get him euvolemic. Hopefully this will work; if not, he should have ultrafiltration so that he is not in heart failure for his operation. He will be at high risk of CHF post-op, and likely will need an ICU bed consider starting hydralazine\/nitroglycerin combination in lieu of ACE-inhibitor for afterload reduction consider a pre-op echo we probably should check his EF and bicuspid aortic valve to exclude severe AI and severe AS Prevention of periperative MI He should continue his ASA, atenolol, statins\/zetia peri-operatively No further testing for ischemia necessary unless is LV function on echo is markedly reduced (recent CABG, no angina) Even with best medical care, for his proposed surgery and his comorbidities he carries a substantial risk for perioperative cardiac complications (roughly 5-10%) Prevention of perioperative AF Continue his atenolol and amiodarone perioperatively Restart coumadin post-op for stroke prevention long term Endocarditis prophylaxis He will need perioperative antibiotics given his bicuspid aortic valve\nWe will follow with you he may need a couple of days to treat his heart failure\/fluid overload prior to surgery.\nXIN Xi, MD, PhD\nStaff Notes:\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2061-08-26\n\n\nMICU Intern Admit Note, Internal Medicine\n\nname: Goins, Jacob MR#:\nTransfer from Linden Health Care Center\nDate of Admission: 08\/25\/61\nFull code\n\nContact information:\n\nCC\/HPI:\n27yo male from Cedar Hill Lakes, Nevada w\/ history of insulin-requiring DM previously followed at Cottage Sanatorium, admitted to Linden Health Care Center after becoming unresponsive during a visit to his sister in Maryland. By report, patient was sitting on the couch at his sister's house, slumped to the floor and had seizure activity x 45seconds that was witnessed by EMS sevices. Accu-checks done at that time were >500 and attempts at intubation were unsuccessful. He was transported to ER, where additional attempts to secure his airway were also unsuccessful, by 2 physicians. There appeared to be some sot of stricture in the upper airway (not obvious on CT scan). However, pt had witnessed emesis, and was placed on 100% nonrebreather mask, with Versed and propofol for sedation with adequate O2 saturation. A x-ray confirmed dependent lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia, and pt was started on Clindamycin.\n\nOn arrival to the ER, patient was also found to have a blood pressure of 248\/146. He received 50mg dose of labetolol in the ER as well as several additional doses in the ICU. In the ICU, patient did not have any further witnessed seizure activity. A Head CT demonstrated no focal lesion, IC hemorrhage or other abnormality. Pt was treated with dilantin and IV insulin infusion. Serum ketones were negative. Additional workup revealed LVH by EKG criteria, as well as renal insufficiency Cr 2.6. Urine tox was positive for benzos, but was otherwise negative.\n\nPatient also developed leukoytosis (WBC ?) with temp of 102 degrees. Although he had minimal neck stiffness by neurology consult exam, he underwent a lumbar puncture that demonstrated a colorless clear fluid, with glucose of 108, TP 44. Grams stain was negative. Tube #4 contained 21RBCs and 7 WBCs with a diff of 96% PMNs and 4% lymphs. CSF cultures and blood cultures were also done, and are pending.\n\nDuring his hospital course, patient maintained adequate oxygenation with nasal trumpet in place. ABG on 08\/25\/61 am was 7.36\/PCO2 45\/ PO2 366, with bicarb of 25 and 100% sats. His FIO2 was subsequently weaned. He remained hemodynamically stable with BP 184\/88 (MAP 114) HR100, RR23, 97% on cannula. Cardiac enzymes were negative. After patient's mother arrived from Georgia, she requested transfer to BMH.\n\nHad no reported history of hypertension or seizure disorders. Mother reports patient having occasional spells in the past, lasting 5-10minutes where patient would become non communicative, associated with elevated glucose.\n\nPMH:\n1.

Neuro - seizure episode \/ unresponsiveness with non localizing neuro exam. Concern for hypertensive encephalopathy. Pt had LP at outside hospital which did not suggest meningitis. Other possibilities include infarct, encephalitis. Neurology consulted, with recommendations for:\nn EEG\nn MRI w\/ susceptibility to evaluate for posterior leukoencephalopathy, MRA head\/neck, MRV brain\nn Dilantin (continued from OSH)\nn Check tox screen, ammonia. Mother has brought in some unknown pills which we will try to identify.\n2. ID - increased WBC, low grade temp s\/p LP. No bacterial source for now, but CXR with opacities suspicious for pneumonia. Will start Vancomycin and cefepime empirically, and narrow per culture results. Concern for encephalitis, as HSV can present w\/ HTN and seizures. Will ask Linden Health to add HSV PCR to CSF taken from LP prior to transfer. Start Acyclovir empirically in interim.\n3. Resp - s\/p multiple attempted intubations at OSH, currently breathing adequately on RA, with audible obstructive physiology. Given need for MRI, may have to sedate and intubate. Will call anesthesia. Continue intubated until MS more alert, for airway protection. Will start ARDSnet for criteria meeting low PaO2\/FIO2 ratio and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.\n4. CV- severe hypertension w\/ evidence of potential end organ damage (kidney\/brain\/cardiac). Will control BP w\/ Nipride drip, with addition of labetalol for HR control. Target goal 25% decrease to SPB~160 today, and SBP 120 the following day. Check CK\/TPNs. Continue IVF for potential rhabdo.\n5. Renal - Renal failure w\/ Cr 2.6, unclear baseline. Suspect acute on chronic component given DM w\/ poor follow-up. Will check Urine sediment, lytes to evaluate. Reading by me is +hyaline\/waxy casts but no WBC or RBC casts. Kidney U\/S pending, also with Doppler to evaluate for RAS. Also check urine renin\/aldo and 24hr metanephrine for pheochromocytoma, serum metanephrine, and 24hr protein for nephritic syndrome in presence of HTN and hematuria.\n6. Endo - tight glucose control; CZI drip for DM. Has gap but No ketones at OSH; did not arrive in DKA. Will need reg insulin after drip DC'd in future.\n7. Access - PIV\n8. Prophylaxis - nexium, heparin SQ, peridex, HOB 30.\n\n\n\n\nInfant Ledford\n#12182\n\n\n* Record date: 2061-10-03\n\nBMH Cancer Center\nHematology Note\n\nFellow: James Tyler\nAttending: Cole Morgan\n\nDate of consultation: October 04, 2061\n\nDiagnosis: thrombocytosis, reactive vs. essential thrombocytosis\n\nHPI:\n27 yo African American male with recent complicated hospital stay at BMH presents to hematology clinic for first time for follow up of his thrombocytosis.\n\nThis 27 yo male with history of type I DM who does not get regular medical care in late August was visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity. At the time, blood sugar was >500. Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248\/146; plt count was in 800's. The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin and transferred to BMH for further care.\n\nAt BMH, MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA- echo was done showing no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well. LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative. He underent a renal workup which showed nephrotic range proteinuria; labs also showed rhabdoymyolysis. Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS. He was continued on abx for his aspiration PNA. Other parts of the secondary htn workup were done including evaluation for hyper aldo, pheo.\n\nThe vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th. HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added. He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.\n\nHematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated. Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's. Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c\/w ACD and he was started on epogen. Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive; CRP was >150 with ESR >100. He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable. But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million. A bone marrow biopsy was done showing no cytogenetics to suggest CML and there were elevated megakaryocytes read as concerning for a myeloproliferative process. As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian\/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter. Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital. As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication. As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer. For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.\n\nHe was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and has done fairly well since then. His energy has been good. He denies any fevers\/chills\/sweats. No bleeding\/bruising. No further swelling in his arms\/legs. He does have some occasionally blurryness in eyes immediately after taking his anti-hypertensives but no numnbess\/weakness\/dizziness.\n\n\nProblems\/PMH:\nDM type 1 since age 12\nno recollection of any abnormal blood counts prior to this admit\n\nNew diagnoses on this admit\nrenal insufficiency\nnephrotic proteinuria\nmalignant hypertension\nthrombocytosis\nGI bleed- upper with ulcer visualized on EGD\nsmall embolic appearing CVA's\n\nMedications:\nDiovan\nlisinopril\nHydrea 1000 bid\nASA 81 qod\nlopressor\nprocardia\nclonidine\nnexium\n\ninsulin: am 25 regular\/34 NPH, pm 20 regular\/28 NPH\n\nAllergies:\nnkda\n\nSocial History:\nlives in waycross; single\nworks in Geologist\nno tob\nreports social etoh\n\nFamily History:\nhtn\n\nPhysical Examination:\n\nVital Signs\nBP 101\/63, P 64, RR 16, Temp 98.1 F, Wt 202 lb\ngen: well-appearing male, alert, conversant, nad\nheent: supple, non-icteric, no cervical\/supraclav adenopathy\nchest: clear\ncv: reg\nabd; benign with no hsm\next: trace LE edema, no upper edema\nskin: scattered ulcerations on his arms with granulation tissue, scarred vesicular changes on his neck\n\n\nData:\n\n10\/03\/2061 WBC 4.1 (L), RBC 3.95 (L), HGB 12.0 (L), HCT 35.5 (L), MCV 90, MCH 30.4, MCHC 33.8, PLT 601 (H)\n\n10\/03\/2061 RDW 17.2 (H)\n\n10\/03\/2061 DIFFR RECEIVED, METHOD, %NEUT 57, %LYMPH 36, %MONO 3 (L), %EOS 3, %BASO 1\n\n10\/03\/2061 ANEUT 2.35, ALYMP 1.48, AMONS 0.10 (L), AEOSN 0.10, ABASOP 0.02\n\n10\/03\/2061 RETIC 1.0\n\n\nAssessment and Plan:\n\nInteresting case of a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency and is found with nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, several small embolic-appearing strokes and has developed marked thrombocytopenia to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT. He was treated for concern of essential thrombocytosis in hospital with platelet pheresis then hydrea. Today, he presents looking well and still has a thrombocytosis despite the hydrea. It is still not possible to tell for sure if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs Essential thrombocytosis.\n\nAt the moment, we will continue to treat this as ET and will continue hydrea at the current dose and ask him to take aspirin 81 mg qd. If this is a reactive process, time should be a good diagnostic test at this should improve after he is further from his complicated hospital\/icu stay.\n\nAt his next visit with us next month we will recheck his C-reactive protein, ESR, iron studies\/ferritin for some idea of whether his body could still be mounting an inflammatory response to drive a reactive thrombocytosis. If his plt count comes down, we will be able to start tapering his hydrea at that time.\n\nOf note, in the near future, we may be able to help determine between reactive and essential process with measurement of the JAK2 kinase level.\n\nIn the meantime, he will be meeting with his new PCP and renal physician next week.\n\n\nJames B.

As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer. For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA. He was discharged from the hospital in September.\nSince then he has been followed in hematology clinic. Initially, his platelets were still in the hi 500's despite hydrea at 1000 bid. His hematocrit was mildly depressed at this point as well (29-31%). He was re-evaluated on 12\/05\/61. His platelets were 502,000. An epo level was drawn and his hydrea was increased to 1500\/1000mg. He was re-evaluated on 12\/26\/61 and found to have a hematocrit of 26.2%, WBC of 2.7K, and platelets of 508,000. His hydrea was decreased to 500mg bid.\nInterval History: Since his last visit, he left for Wynne for one month. When he returned, his creatinine had increased to 4.0. A renal biopsy performed last week showed diabetic nephropathy. He is being evaluated by Dr. Xing for dialysis and renal transplant evaluation.\nIn terms of his blood disorders, the patient has been at his baseline fatigue, slightly improving over the past few months. He has no fevers, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss. He had one episode of transient global blurry vision 3 weeks ago which resolved on its own and has not recurred.

In this setting, he has developed marked thrombocytosis to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT. He was treated with platelet pheresis, then hydrea. It has been unclear if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs essential thrombocytosis. We are following his CBC on hydrea.\nHis platelets are moderately elevated (757K). He has no evidence of recurrent thrombosis. His current hydrea dosing cannot be increased due to his anemia. We would advise starting erythropoetin, monitoring his blood pressure closely. At his current platelet count, his risk of thrombosis is not greatly increased, especially as his platelets are dysfunctional due to uremia. We would advise continuing current hydrea.\nContinue current hydrea Monitor counts monthly Agree with starting erythropoetin in Internal Medicine. Return in 4 months for follow-up of counts\nThe patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Morgan.\n\nInge J. Logan, M.D.\n\n\n* Record date: 2062-05-30\n\n\nInternal Medicine\nBARTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\n\nHistory of present illness\n\nThis was a followup visit for this 28-year-old black man with the medical problems of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thrombocytosis, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient states that since I last saw him, he is being evaluated further for renal transplant. In addition, attempts were made to place an AV fistula for dialysis in his right arm and this did not work out. Given that this one did not work out, a decision was made to wait to see if there was a transplant candidate for him to get a renal transplant rather than put all of the pieces in place for hemodialysis if in fact he would need it. Most recently, the patient's creatinine was 6.4 and his BUN was 46 two weeks ago.\n\nMajor Problems\n\n\nDiabetes mellitus\nType 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient's diabetes is currently well controlled on his current regimen of NPH and Regular Insulin. Most recently, his hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 on 02\/27\/2062. The patient states that all of his fingersticks at home have been consistently between 70 and 110.\n\nChronic renal insufficiency\nThe patient is being evaluated for renal transplant and possible candidate that his family members and friends will be tested to see whether there are a match shortly.\n\nHypertension\nThe patient is on a tremendous amount of medication to treat his hypertension. Currently, he is on labetalol 600 mg PO BID, furosemide 20 mg PO QD, clonidine 0.3 mg PO QHS, lisinopril 40 mg PO QD, and nifedipine XL 90 mg PO QHS. BHypertension is currently well controlled on this regimen.\n\nErectile dysfunction\nThe patient was experiencing erectile dysfunction largely on Toprol. For this reason, the Toprol was discontinued and the patient is having less of a problem with this issue currently.\n\nAnemia\nThe patient's anemia is due to multiple different factors. He has recently been started on erythropoietin, which he is getting via injection in the Internal Medicine three times a week.

She was referred to us by Dr. Michael. Ms. Yount has a history of diabetes mellitus for the last seven years. She also has a long history of hypertension. She retired from IBM in 2085 after working there for many years. Her last posting was as a electrical mechanic. She is feeling well. She denies headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. She also denies shortness of breath or complex partial seizures. She denies swelling and presence of dysuria, fever, chills. She is taking her medications regularly. ALLERGIES No known drug allergies. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 1. Diabetes mellitus for about seven years. 2. Hypertension.\n3. PVD\n4. Hypercholesterolemia\nSOCIAL HISTORY She denies smoking or drinking. She has one son living with her.\nFAMILY HISTORY Positive for diabetes. MEDICATIONS Norvasc 10 mg q. day,\nGlucophage 500 mg twice a day,\nGlucotrol 5 mg twice a day,\nAvandia 4 mg q. day, (she had incresed skin itching with attempts to increase the dose)\nLipitor 10 mg q. day,\nAspirin 325 mg a day (she is not taking aspirin).\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS Ms. Yount denies any recent visual change, headaches. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, fever, chills.\nPHYSICAL EXAM Ms. Yount looks well. Blood pressure is 148\/90. Body weight is 188. Repeat blood pressure is 170\/80. On examination of head and neck - no absolutely. Thyroid is soft, nontender, no nodules. Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation. Heart - regular rate and rhythm, no S3. Abdomen is soft, bowel sounds present. Extremities - trace edema. LABORATORY Pending. IMPRESSION Ms. Yount has diabetes and hypertension with a mildly elevated creatinine. Her urine shows presence of protein, which suggests diabetic nephropathy. Upon review of her medications, she is on a very good medication control, and her blood pressure has been well controlled. However, today the blood pressure is running higher. I will see her in about two to three months. If her blood pressure continues to be high, we should try to increase her dose of ARB. I also explained to Ms. Yount the importance of taking aspirin and that she should continue her daily aspirin.

She apparently had a fall, which caused substantial pain and some swelling, but no bruising. Brought her in to have an evaluation. X-rays showed no fracture and over the last few weeks things have improved substantially, and she comes in just because she was told to get it checked out by her doctors, but otherwise feeling quite good and wondering if the appointment is even necessary.\n\nPast medical history includes high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nNo prior surgeries.\n\nNo medications.\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\nLists no family history of any problems.\n\nLives alone and used to smoke, but quit.\n\nOn examination, she has full range of motion of her wrist compared to the opposite side. No atrophy, ecchymosis, edema or deformity. Negative scaphoid shift test. Slight tenderness over the distal radius. Normal tendon function.\n\nMy impression is that she must have got a mild sprain, which has recovered or possibly even a nondisplaced fracture given her age and osteoporotic bone, but whatever this was, it has resolved almost entirely, she is functioning well, and there is no apparent problem, so I will see her back as needed.\n\n\nYoel Newcomb, M.D.\n\nCC: Dustin T.

Th patient was well and normally active with walking and usual activities without DOE until 2 days ago. Last routine visit was in 9\/91 w\/ her PCP and was fine. 2 days ago noted DOE when going to store. This persisted w\/ activity only. The patient was fine at rest and was able to sleep without difficulty. There were no recent changes in her meds. She had no other symptoms including CP, dizziness, URI symptoms, fever, chills, GI symptoms. No PND, orthopnea.\n\nShe previously had a cardiac evaluation during a similar presentation in 2085. She had a low level stress test and echocardiogram. No ischemia was demonstrated at a very minimal exertion. The echo showed LVH and an EF of 61%. Because of an impending snow storm, she decided to come to the hospital for evaluation. In the ED her BP was elevated and her 02 sat was only 78% on RA.\n\nPMH:\n1.

Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT. Last ETT in 2085 but was normal at a very low level of exertion. Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process? If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative. Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w\/ fine crackles. Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms. Continue current regimen w\/ holding Avandia and metformin.\n\nPage #96082\n\nSigned electronically by Oconnell, Philip D on Feb 05, 2092\n\n* Record date: 2092-08-02\n\nMichael, Dana\nInternal Medicine Associates, Wuite K\nMount San Rafael Hospital, 2nd Floor, Room 205\nSnowflake, HI, 99981-2297\nRE: PATRICIA YOUNT\n8\/2\/2092\nAdmission Note\ncc: SOB\nHPI: please refer to prior d\/c summaries (April and May 2092) for details of PMHx.

I agree with the findings and recommendations in Dr. Lilly's note, with any small exceptions or points of emphasis noted below. Please refer to it for details of HPI, PMH, medications and allergies, family and social history, laboratory and other data, and ROS. I would only add\/emphasize the following:\n\nMr. Gillespie is a 53 year-old man with medical history that includes:\nh\/p Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, 2070-2071, treated with local resection, bleomycin, adriamycin, and other agents, XRT to a wide chest field Atrial fibrillation - diagnosed in 3\/84; on warfarin, metoprolol Pectus excavatum &#8211; repair failed as a child Pneumonia several times in the past Central obesity &#8211; weighs about 315#, down from a high of 360# Type II diabetes mellitus, last A1C 6.4, on metformin only, 1000 mg BID Hypertension, on lisinopril 10 mg, Toprol XL Elevated lipids - on statin Neurofibromatosis (Soft tissue mass in right apex noted on 3\/84 CT may be neurogenic tumor.) Kidney stones Patent foramen ovale\nHe presents with dyspnea, orthopnea, and palpitations as described by Dr. Lilly, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation\/flutter with rapid ventricular response. He has improved with heart rate control.\nExam VS - as noted General - pleasant obese white man with severe pectus deformity. Breathing with abdominal muscles tensed on expiration. CV - heart with regular rhythm, normal S1, prominent S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Lungs - clear Abdomen - obese Extremities - minimal edema\nData - reviewed in detail and are as in Dr. Lilly's note. Bicarb 31, BNP 2050, WBC 15, INR 3.1.\n\nImpression: Poorly tolerated atrial fibrillation\/flutter with RVR, needing better rate control. Given the severe pectus deformity as well as his history of lung-toxic chemotherapy drugs and XRT, he may have some restrictive lung disease that would limit his cardiopulmonary reserve. I would not be surprised if he additionally has obstructive lung disease, given the belly breathing and the wheezing he had last admission.\nRecommendations:\nIncrease metoprolol dose. May need Toprol XL 100 BID. Best to maximize utility of BB prior to adding other agents.\nFilter all IVs (PFO) PFTs and Pulmonology consult as an outpatient Balance of plan per Dr. Lilly.\n\n\nPeter Wiggins, MD, PhD pager 32089\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2084-06-15\n\nPATIENT: Patrick Gillespie MRN: 2571454 ADMIT DATE: 6\/13\/84 TRANSFER DATE: 6\/15\/84 ATTN: Wright\n\nReason for admission\/transfer: aflutter starting on sotalol\nHPI Please see admission note for full details.\nIn brief, this is a 54 y\/o M hx neurofibromatosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma s\/p chemo\/XRT in the 70s, DMII (A1c 6.5 in 03\/84), HTN, obesity and new diagnosis of Afib, recently discharged from the Mediquik 2 days prior to readmission 6\/13 where he was being treated for AF w\/ RVR.

This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours. She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself. The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline. In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated. She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait. She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect.\n\nShe recalls one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed. The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up. She has no known history of seizures. Migraines occur 1-2x\/year, preceeded by scintillating scotoma, associated with nausea, photophobia, relieved by sleep.

Dr. Remigio Allison was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan. We spent greater than 50% of the visit in education and counseling of the patient and family.\nHPI: As you know, Ms. Klein is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s\/p LAD stent (2144), migraine, who was in her USOH until the afternoon of 2\/6\/50 when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty expressing myself while cooking lunch for she and her husband. This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours. She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself. In particular she related several examples of semantic paraphasic errors. The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline. In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated. She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait. She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect. She recalled one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed. The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up. She has no known history of seizures but migraines occur 1-2x\/year, last 30 minutes to several hours and are typically preceeded by scintillating scotoma ( jagged horizontal lines ), associated with nausea\/photophobia, and relieved by sleep.\nGiven her multiple vascular risk factors, she was admitted for TIA work-up which was unremarkable with the exception of mildly elevated HbA1c (7.0) including lipids, ESR, homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), TTE and holter. CT\/CT-a and MRI did not show any evidence of acute stroke or significant cervical or intracranial arterial stenosis. She was discharged on her home medications, which included ASA 325mg po qd, with a diagnosis of complex migraine. Since return home, she has had additional typical episodes of migraine, (about every 2 weeks) without the aphasia which brought her into the hospital. She has tried Excedrin migraine a few times recently, with good results.\nROS: Sometimes sees stars when she stands up too quickly after bending over. Similarly feels that her balance is transiently affected when getting out of bed in the morning ( I rock ). She is awaiting thyroid biopsy of the nodules incidentally discovered on CT-CT-a. Negative in detail including change in weight, energy, appetite, CP, palpitations, SOB, DOE, N\/V\/D\/cough, fever, chills, rash, BRBPR, melena, abdominal pain, change in bowel or bladder habits. In addition, patient denies change in vision, hearing, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, weakness, slurred speech, difficulty with language, swallowing, eating, or gait.\nPast Medical History: CAD s\/p LAD stent 2144 HTN Hyperlipidemia Migraine HA: +scintillating scotoma, +photophobia, +nauea, relieved with sleep.

Since discharge, she has continued to have her baseline migraines at a frequency of ~ 2x\/month. At this point, we would not recommend beginning prophylactic therapy, but would consider doing so if attacks become more frequent. Given her clinical response to Excedrin migraine, we have suggested continuing this drug for abortive therapy, but have spoken at length about the phenomenon of rebound headache and cautioned her about using it more than once every 10-14 days. We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIA\/stroke; thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non-stereotyped deficits seriously. She will follow-up with us in 4-6 months or sooner if the need arises.\nThank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient. We look forward to seeing her in follow-up.\nSincerely,\nOlen X. Laughlin, M.D. Neurology Resident Pager 63030\nI have seen and examined the patient with Dr. Laughlin, resident in Neurology, and repeated or observed all the key elements of the encounter before discussing the assessment and management.

You know Michelle well, she does have coronary artery disease, has had an LAD stent placed in 2148, and had a normal stress sestamibi study in November 2151. She has moderate mitral insufficiency. Her left atrial dimension is 52 and RV pressure 42. She is diabetic and has hypertension. She was hospitalized with a diarrheal bleeding issue attributed to salmonella infection attributed to tomatoes it also affecting her husband and this was accomplished at the Copley Hospital.\nHer medications were modified somewhat. She presently takes atenolol 50 mg a day, verapamil 120 mg per day, Lipitor 10 mg a day, Diovan 80 mg per day, they held her aspirin and her Imdur, she takes Prilosec 40 mg BID, and metformin 500 mg BID. Her blood pressure remains high today at 147\/70, it had been similar range when I saw her in June this year. Pending her diarrhea at home, we may need to go back up on some of her medications, but at this point we will change. She is symptom free vis-a-vie her heart.\nHer exam shows no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Normal thyroid, normal neck veins, and arteries. Clear lungs. Normal abdomen, nontender, and no mass felt. Her heart palpates normally. There were no thrills and no scars. Her first sound is soft and second is normal. There is a 1\/6 apical mitral insufficiency murmur with positive response to isometrics. There were no diastolic murmurs. Blood pressure is 145\/70.\nThe electrocardiogram was normal with trace nonspecific ST flattening.\nI will plan to reassess Michelle in four months and she will have a recheck several times a month of her blood pressure at home and she will send diaries to me. If her blood pressure is continued at home to be in her present level, we will advance her medications to accommodate this. If there are any questions feel free to call me.\nSincerely yours,\nTony Wilkinson, MD\nSigned electronically by Tony Wilkinson, MD Document Status: Final\n\n* Record date: 2154-07-21\nCARDIOLOGY\nVALLEY COUNTY HOSPITAL\nEva Newby M.D. Valley County Hospital ,\nDear Dr. Newby:\nI was happy to see Michelle Klein (2474410: DOB August 6, 2075) who comes along with her husband, Nathaniel, for follow up cardiac evaluation. Michelle has been stable from a cardiac point of view. She has coronary artery disease and underwent LAD stent placement in 2148. She had negative stress sestamibi study in November 2151. She has been free of angina or cardiac-related symptoms. She notes occasional orthostatic dizziness. Her prior stamina symptoms have improved greatly. She has well-controlled hypertension on stable medical regimen. Her recent diagnosis of myelofibrosis has been followed through closely by her hematology group here at Valley County and we have discussed this at length. Michelle feels far better than at her last several visits and I am very happy to see this.\nOn clinical exam, blood pressure right arm is 130\/80 mmHg, pulses are equal, normal and all well felt. First heart sound is normal to soft. Second is normal. There is a 1+\/6 systolic apical murmur. No diastolic murmurs are present. No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. Thyroid is postoperative and stable. Neck veins are flat. Carotid upstrokes are normal. Lungs are clear. Abdominal exam is normal. I do not feel enlargement of the abdominal aorta.\nThe electrocardiogram is unchanged. It continues to show minimal nonspecific ST flattening and left atrial prominence.\nMedications: Michelle no longer takes the verapamil, atenolol 50 mg per day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, Diovan 40 mg daily, Protonix 40 mg b.i.d, Synthroid 1.12 mg per day, vitamin B12 500 mg, B6 100 mg, magnesium 400 mg per day, and D3 2000 IU per day.\nIf there are any questions at anytime, please call me. I am happy to see Michelle 's spirits are good and that she is feeling better and actually, her clinical exam seems excellent as well. She does not manifest tachycardia. I note that her hematocrit is 31%. Visit duration 40 min.-half in discussion re he cardiac and hematologic issues.\nBest regards.\nSincerely yours,\nTony Wilkinson, MD\nSigned electronically by Tony Wilkinson, MD Document Status: Final\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2084-10-14\nIORIO, Olivia (9290228)\n\nOFFICE VISIT: 10\/14\/84\n\nThis 28-year-old young woman, status post two failed renal transplants, re-presents for evaluation.

She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases\n\nInterval History:\nMs. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea. She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.\n\nShe was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%. Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%. She had global hypokinesis.\n\nShe was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease. She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion. Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT. d dimer 400 rnage. BNP elevated at 500. VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe. Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus. Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable. A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease. Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.\n\nThe patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg. Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.\n\nUnfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:\nLasix 20mg\nToprol XL 50mg\nASA 325mg\nZestril 20mg\nLantus 10 units hs\nGlucovance 2.5\/500mg\nMultivitamin\n\nShe relates that her dyspnea is better\n\nShe is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part. She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.\n\n\nPast medical history:\n1. Diabetes\n2. Hypertension\n3. Hyperlipidemia\n4. Sick Sinus syndrome requiring permanant pacemaker\n5. cardiomypathy\n6. Minimal CAD by cath 2090\n\nFamily history:\nNo significant cardiac disease\n\nSocial history:\nShe and her husband are doing well. She has retired. Daughter is finished with college and Quarry Worker in the Bristow area.\n\nReview of systems:\nPatinet is improved with regard to exertional tolerance as noted. Denies edema, PND, orthopnea. Still has dyspnea with walking flat ground but not until 1-2 blocks.\n\nPhysical examination:\n-BP: 130\/80\n-General appearance: No acute distress.\n-Skin: No rashes, anicteric.\n-Heent: Unremarkable\n-Neck: CVP 8. No carotid bruits\n-Chest: Clear to auscultation and percussion.\n-Cardiac: S1 S2. No significant murmurs. PMI normal.\n-Abdomen: Obese, soft, no hepatosplenomegly\n-Extremities: Good pulses, no edema\n-Neuro: Non-focal\n-Pulse: 89\n\nEKG:\nAtrial triggered ventricular pacing with borderline first degree AV block.\n\nImpression:\nMs. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.\n\nHer evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.\n\nShe was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive. Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.\n\nAt this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.\n\nDepending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis\/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.\n\nIn addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication. She relates that she will call our office.\n\nSigned electronically by Samantha G Noland MD on Jul 27, 2094\n\n* Record date: 2098-12-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeurology Resident ED Consult Note\n\nPatient Name: Neill, Jennifer K\nMRN: 4634248\n\nPCP: Dr William Joslin\n\nDate\/Time\/Place of Exam\/Initial Assessment: 12\/11\/98, 8 PM, PMC ED.\n\nReason for Consult: Abnormal speech\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 71 year-old right-handed woman with multiple medical problems who presents with subacute speech abnormality.\n\nShe was well before going to bed on 12\/09\/98.

As you recall he is a 71-year-old gentleman who is status post angioplasty on the left for high-grade stenotic lesions of the distal superficial femoral artery and the popliteal artery on the left. The patient presents now for further evaluation of his claudication symptoms.\nThe patient states he has bilateral lower extremity symptoms, there are about equivalent in nature. He has very minimal low back pain. He states it seems to be getting worse and seems to be associated with some abnormal gait. He states on a bad day its about a 9\/10 and even on a good day sometimes it can be as high as 8-9\/10. The episodes are almost daily and are brought on by things like walking. He can walk less than one block at which point he has lateral calf burning and at times notes some slow shuffling and occasionally falling. When he is having severe symptoms he notes his legs to be weak. He denies any bowel or bladder abnormalities of late, but has a historic of a chronic UTI secondary to his benign prostatic hypertrophy. He has very little back pain associated with his symptomatology. He has had no physical therapy to date and no spinal injections. He describes his general health as poor, but when specially asked he states it is because he his 71 and has a history of hypertension. Years ago he stated he was in excellent health. His weight is steady at 200 with no significant weight gain or loss. He doesn't smoke and drinks socially. Quit smoking 33 years ago. He does not think he will ever be pain free.\nReview of Systems: Reveals that he is a diet controlled diabetic and he has been for the past couple of years. He has difficulty with sleep. He has a balance problem and also has benign prostatic hypertrophy leading to chronic urinary tract infection, for this he takes Cardura. He has a history of high blood pressure. Denies any other cardiovascular abnormality. No respiratory malfunction. He has had surgery for something in his colon he has also had a bypass surgery. He is on Plavix and aspirin.\nPhysical Examination: Shows that he is solid built, healthy appearing male. He is able to toe and heel walk but on the left side his T band seems to be slightly weak. Single toe raises show that the right leg is stronger than the left leg. He has no tenderness to his PSIS and he has no Waddell signs. He has negative Trendelenburg bilaterally. Forward flexion allows him to get to the patella. Extension is pain free and passive hyperextension does not reproduce the symptoms.\nMotor testing is normal in his lower extremities. Sensory is symmetric. He has negative straight leg raises. He has no palpable pulses. He is hairless in his lower extremities. He had no clonus or Babinski and a negative Hoffman's suggesting that he is not myelopathic despite his balance abnormality.\nHe is on multiple meds for his hypertension, for his diabetes, and for his gastroesophageal reflux.\nPersonal review of his plain films and a CAT scan indicating with, show decent residual lumbar lordosis with a stent noted in his iliac artery on the right. CT scan shows lumbosacral facet hypertrophy.\nAt this point, impression is of spinal stenosis and degenerative disk disease. I have asked him to obtain an MRI and return to see me after that.\nThanks for the referral.\n\n\nStephen Nichols, M.D.\nDictated By: Stephen Nichols\neScription document:6-0190274 EFFocus\n\nDD: 11\/14\/54 DT: 11\/14\/54 DV: 11\/14\/54\n\n* Record date: 2155-07-11\n\nJuly 11, 2155\n\nName: Olive, Xavier\nMRN: 26690002\n\nMr. Olive was seen with Dr. Innis in general neurology clinic on 07\/11\/55.

His referring physician is Dr. Ximena Keane, practicing out of Alexandria Clinic. Mr. Olive also heard about the TMH VC through TV advertisements.\n\nHe is 73 years old, has history of diabetes starting in 2135, known history of peripheral artery disease with claudication and calf discomfort, for which he has previously seen Dr. Cain at Alexandria Clinic, and also has been evaluated and treated at the Corcoran District Hospital. Specifically, he describes having been evaluated by Dr. Cain and others some three or four years ago, and undergoing at least two procedures, all related to his legs cramping up. He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery, so far as I can tell. The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center (Big Rapids, AC) and also he had evaluation at the Corcoran District Hospital, and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there. The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times, but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all. Currently, he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast, and this stops him at about 50 yards.\n\nThe issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive parkinsonian-type symptoms, walking in a shuffle, tipping forward, and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely. His legs are rubbery, and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it happens. It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything. At the same time, his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication, and he has known peripheral artery disease. Also feels though his hips sometimes are cramping up. The patient feels quite disabled by his symptoms, especially as a gentleman who was active and never had physical problems of this nature. Again, there is some degree of blurring between the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication, as to which is truly causing his disability.\n\nPast medical history:\nDiabetes, onset in 2135.\nParkinsonian-type movement disorder, followed by Dr. Jeffers and Innis, and for which he was placed on Sinemet, presuming it was due to Parkinson's. The patient has not improved despite trying the medications.

Nondrinker. He smoked until 30 years ago.\n\nReview of systems:\nDetailed review of systems was carried out. It was also reviewed on the patient questionnaire sheet that the patient brought with him. He does claim to have some dyspnea with exertion as well as intermittent indigestion consistent with GERD. He has nocturia. He wears dentures. No significant weight loss or anorexia. No visual changes or other neurologic symptoms other than the gait disturbance and neuropathy. He denies chest discomfort or anything to suggest cardiac ischemia. Otherwise, review of systems is negative in detail.\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-Pulse: 68 and regular. Afebrile\n-BP: 105\/55, obtained by myself. Equal bilaterally\n-General: Well-developed male in no distress, appears his stated age. Slightly stooped over, and has a parkinsonian-type affect and appearance\n-Skin: Without rashes\n-Heent: Normal facies, or slightly masked, with normal extraocular motions and reactive pupils\n-Neck: Carotid upstrokes are normal, no bruits. No JVD\n-Chest: Clear\n-Cardiac: Discloses normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmurs\n-Abdomen: Moderately obese, protuberant, soft, and nontender. Good bowel sounds, no organomegaly, no enlargement of the aorta. May be a soft bruit in the midline to deep auscultation\n-Extremities: Femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally, with soft bruits on both sides. Below this, no cyanosis or edema (perhaps trace to 1+ edema), and posterior tibial pulses are 1 to 2+. Dorsalis pedis pulses are not easily palpable. Good capillary refill\n-Neuro: Gait is disturbed, with slight shuffling and slightly stooped. His strength is normal, and sensory findings are slightly abnormal with diminished sensation in a stocking-glove distribution. He does not have any cogwheeling to my examination. Otherwise, no focal deficits\n\nProcedures:\n\nFree text procedures Exercise ABIs-resting ABI is normal on the right and left at 0. 92 and 1.03, respectively. The toe brachial index drops to 0.29 on the right side and 0.91 at 1 minute after exercise. I am not sure what to make of these ABIs since it appears that the actual ankle-brachial indices were not measured following exercise.\n\nEKG:\ndemonstrates normal sinus rhythm or sinus bradycardia at heart rate of 55. There is normal axis and intervals, with no evidence of prior infraction, and perhaps a slight right ventricular conduction delay.\n\nOther Data:\nDOB: 11\/25\/2083.\n\nAssessment and plan:\nLower extremity arterial disease (PAD)-the patient clearly has history of PAD with prior interventions on both sides. Currently, complains of symptoms that sound like claudication, predominantly involving the calves on both sides, right slightly ahead of the left, and I would not be surprised if he has significant focal obstructive disease along the length of his iliac of SFA. Since his ABIs are well preserved at rest, I suspect he does not have pre-occlusion of the SFA, for example. On the other hand, he does have diabetes and his ABIs may be falsely elevated.\n\nHis major limitation is due to a combination of the claudication that occurs less than 50 yards and stops him at that point, and the gait disturbance that he has related to his movement disorder, possible Parkinson's disease. I am not sure that this latter entity has been well enough defined, and I would suggest that we have him see a neurologist here to better ascertain the nature of that disease, and as to whether there is anything better available in the way of treatment.\n\n1. As far his peripheral artery disease, it would be extremely helpful to obtain films from AC and\/or the CDH, to better define what procedures were actually performed and where stents were placed. Given that it has been a year or more since his last intervention, it is likely he will need another angiographic study (or MRA\/CTA) in order to ascertain the nature of his disease.\n\n2. Neurologic disorder-we will refer to a neurologist.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Formal exercise ABIs.\n2. Obtain angiographic studies from AC.\n3. Followup visit in one month.\n4.

He has had a dry cough for about two months. He was put on inhalers, but there was no improvement. The cough is worse at night, but also he has it during the day. He has no mucus production, no hemoptysis, no shortness of breath, and no wheezing. He is a nonsmoker. About a week ago, he was admitted to a local emergency room for chest pain. He was rushed to Ochiltree General because of ST-T wave abnormalities on his EKG. In retrospect, he has had these changes for many years, and anyway he had a cardiac catheterization, which showed mild obstruction of some of his coronary systems but no evidence of coronary artery syndrome. He did have cardiomyopathy with the ejection fraction of 35%. He was sent home on Toprol XL 50 mg QD, Lipitor 10 mg QD, lisinopril 10 mg, aspirin 325 mg once a day, and Avandia 2 mg once a day.

His EF was 34%. He underwent cardiac cath which showed that the Left Main and LAD were patent, a very distal LCX lesion. RCA was dominant and patent. The patient was discharged to home on a program of ace, BB, ASA and instructed to curtail his ETOH use. His EF improved to 66 %. He had repeat nuclear stress testing which showed small anterior infarct\/small prior inferior infarct and was negative for ischemia in July 2068. Since then he has had a stable angina pattern with chest pain brought on when he has to move very heavy objects in his work as a packager. This is usually relieved with one TNG. Most recently, he was seen by his PC Dr. Thomson and treated with Augmentin\/Robitussin AC for a URI. He had a productive cough and some chest discomfort related to coughing. Most recently, he was brought into police custody for public intoxication. While in his jail cell,resting he developed the sudden onset on midsternal sharp chest pain accompanied by heavy breathing. There was no radiation to the arms, but he noted bilateral hand numbness. He also had palpitations and sweating and felt nauseated. He received one sl TNG. An ambulance was called and he received 2 TNG sprays. His pain diminished. His BP was 176\/100 at the time. He was brought to the Evanston Hospital ER and found to have high lateral changes on his EKG's. Troponins were slightly elevated at .13- considered a gray zone for the hospitals range for MI. The patient was pain free after a dose of Morphine. While in the hospital, he was placed on suicide watch. He has a history of a suicide attempt 3 years ago and has previously had counseling and been on antidepressants. He has a son who is in a vegetative state after an MVA whom he helps care for and this is very stressful. His recent arrest made hiite despondent. At Evanston Hospital, he was started on a beta blocker and Lovenox. He had a suboptimal stress test which was stopped because of SSCP and nausea. He is now transferred to OGH for further evaluation.\nPast medical history: diabetes Cardiomyopathy(?ETOH related) CAD- 50 % LCX lesion 3\/67 Depression with suicide attempt 3 years ago- was on antidepressants until 6 months ago Obesity\n\nChanges to Allergies No known allergies No known drug allergy\nMedications (Confirmed):\naspirin 325 mg daily Augmentin 500mg\/125mg po q8h x 10 days Levitra 20mg po daily PRN Lipitor 10 mg daily lisinopril 40 mg daily metformin hydrochloride 500 mg daily Patanol 0.1% eye drops Prilosec 20 mg daily Robitussin ac 100mg\/10mg\/5ml po q4-6h PRN cough Synalar ointment 0.025% Voltaren 75 mg BID PRN\nFamily history: non contributory\nSocial history: working until recently- was packaging manager for Johnson & Johnson no smoking rare etoh- one glass red wine with evening meal Lives with wife\/2 daughters- has son in vegetative state after car accident whom family cares for\nReview of systems: see above. remainder negative in detail\nPhysical examination: -BMI: 42.6 Obese, high risk -Pulse: 62 bpm -weight: 225 lbs. -Neck: jvp 6 cm without bruits -Chest: Clear to auscultation and percussion. -Cardiac: Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced.

She has been in Rhode Island for six months. Her complaint is that she has heaviness in the chest. She does not have any palpitations. She does not note that this is associated with exertion. She does have diaphoresis associated with it. She does not have any shortness of breath. This heaviness has been in her chest on and off for the last six weeks. She is quite concerned.\nShe has a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension. She also has hyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor. Her health maintenance has been in order. She has just had a hysterectomy. She needs to have a follow-up mammogram done. However, today I am most concerned about her chest heaviness.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her blood pressure is 130\/80, respiratory rate is 20 and pulse is 68. Neck is supple. There is no lymphadenopathy. Chest is clear to both percussion and auscultation. Cardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs. Abdomen is soft and nontender. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing and edema.\nLABORATORY DATA: Her sodium is 145, electrolytes are all otherwise within normal limits. TSH is 2.0. LFTs are pending at this time. We sent her for an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes. We also sent her for an exercise tolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a maximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 seconds. She had no evidence of ischemia.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Chest heaviness. I am not sure what is causing this. She may have a primary pulmonary problem. She will be following up with us in one week. It is heartening to see that she does not have an abnormal exercise tolerance test. 2. Hypothyroidism, well controlled at the present time. Continue same dose of Synthroid. 3. Hypertension, well controlled presently. 4. Hyperlipidemia. We will recheck this on her next visit.\n\nRE: Russell, Donna MRN #: 10418061 May 12, 2079 Page 2\nWe will also need to schedule a follow-up mammogram.\n\nQuinn Rutledge, M.D.\nQR\/QR5 957307.doc DD: 05\/25\/2079 DT: 05\/27\/2079 DV: 05\/12\/2079\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2079-06-23\n\nMERCY CARE CENTER Mercy Internal Medicine Associates 18 Newburgh Street Terrell, AR 72985\nRussell, Donna 10418061 06\/23\/79\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Russell is returning for follow up. She has had couple of further episodes of this peculiar sensation in which her arm feels like it goes dead and then she gets some pressure in her chest. She gets a slight shortness of breath. It lasts 30 seconds. She gets as many as three or four a day. The frequency has, however, decreased and she is feeling better and better, as she begins to lose some weight. I think weight loss is going to be critical. She also is less fatigued as she begins to lose weight.\nHer hypertension has been under better control. Hydrochlorothiazide seems to be helping quite a bit in addition to the atenolol.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure is 146\/86. Weight has gone from 200 to 196 pounds. Respiratory rate is 20. Pulse is 64. Neck is supple. There is no lymphadenopathy. Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation. Cardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs. Abdomen is soft and nontender. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing and edema.\nLABORATORY DATA: Electrolytes are within normal limits.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN 1. Hypertension. Relatively well controlled on hydrochlorothiazide plus atenolol. 2. Weight. Now began to lose some weight and feeling much better as a result of it. 3. Peculiar chest pressure. I do not think she has coronary artery disease given the exercise test. In light of this, we will try to control her blood pressure and get her to lose some weight. Hopefully, this will help with the resolution of her symptoms.\n\nQuinn Rutledge, M.D.\nQR\/RM5 855930.do c DD: 06\/27\/2079 DT: 06\/28\/2079 DV: 06\/23\/2079\n\n\n* Record date: 2079-08-11\n\nMERCY CARE CENTER MERCY Internal Medicine Associates 07 Newburgh Street Terrell, AR 72985\nRussell, Donna 10418061 08\/11\/79\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Russell returns for further evaluation. She has been doing very well. She has been exercising and has lost from 200 to 170 pounds. She is feeling very well.\nNotably, Dr. Lu sent her for a follow-up ETT. He did not find the first ETT acceptable. The second ETT was grossly positive. As a result of this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a nitrate. She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of pain that she was having before when she went up steps.\nShe did have hyperlipidemia. We have put her on Lipitor, which has provided some control. However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which is not an excellent ratio. Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal limits.\nShe also has right shoulder lipoma. This has become apparent since she lost so much weight. She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have recommended Dr. Dawson.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is 120\/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64. Neck is supple. There is no lymphadenopathy. Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation. Cardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Abdomen is soft and nontender. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema.\nLABORATORY DATA: None today.\nRussell, Donna 10418061 08\/11\/79 Page 2\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. CAD. We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate. I also gave her nitroglycerine. We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but continue her atenolol. She is also on one aspirin a day along with Premarin and Synthroid. 2. Weight loss. She will continue to exercise. I suspect she is going to lose more weight. This is excellent. 3. Coronary artery disease. Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a cardiac catheterization. It is his opinion, and I must concur that this is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell. She is going to delay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment done on this variety of medical issues.\n\nQuinn Rutledge, M.D.\nQR\/RM5 055626.doc DD: 08\/16\/2079 DT: 08\/18\/2079 DV: 08\/11\/2079\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2092-08-16\nEDVISIT^06129040^MACK, ROSE^08\/16\/92^GRAHAM, ANGELA\nThis patient's visit was shared with PA, Quiring. I also\npersonally interviewed and examined this patient.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50-year-old female with\npast medical history of type 1 diabetes, peripheral vascular\ndisease, and hypothyroidism who presents for evaluation of an\ninfected left heel ulcer. The patient is status post bypass\ngrafting in her lower extremities and skin grafting of a\nnonhealing ulcer on her right heel. Since that time, she has\ndeveloped a chronic nonhealing ulcer on the left heel, which has\nbeen followed closely by VNA. Today, she was seen by her VNA who\nwas very concerned about redness and swelling of her left foot\nwith redness that extended underneath the plantar surface of the\nfoot and over the dorsal surface and concern for infection of\nthis ulcer. The patient has minimal sensation in the left foot.\nShe states sometimes she can feel a pressure sensation. She does\nhave some pain when she tries to weightbear, has not noted any\nfevers, has noted some chills and states that her fingerstick\nearlier today was elevated. She denies any abdominal pain,\nnausea, or vomiting. She does note that her foot does appear to\nbe somewhat slightly more swollen but has not noticed redness up\nuntil today.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Positive for hypothyroidism, type 1\ndiabetes, and peripheral vascular disease with a nonhealing\ndiabetic foot ulcers.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She is status post femoral bypass\ngrafting, thyroidectomy, skin grafting for nonhealing wounds, and\nright foot debridement in the past.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She smoked in the past, does not drink. She\nlives with family, is followed by a VNA, and is not working.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Reviewed and is also positive for diabetes.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: All other systems reviewed and otherwise\nnegative except per the HPI.\nMEDICATIONS: Insulin.\nALLERGIES: She has an allergy to codeine, aspirin, erythromycin,\noxycodone, and sulfa.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 105,\nrespirations 16, blood pressure 117\/70, and O2 saturations are\n100% on room air. The patient is awake, alert, frail, and thin\nfemale. She is in no respiratory distress. Her head examination\nis normocephalic and atraumatic. Her conjunctivae are slightly\npale. She has moist mucous membranes. The airway is patent.\nHer neck is supple with full range of motion without any pain.\nThe trachea is midline. Her lungs are clear to auscultation\nbilaterally with equal breath sounds. No respiratory distress,\nno accessory muscle use, and no chest wall tenderness. Her\ncardiac examination is tachycardic and regular at about 100 with\na 3\/6 systolic murmur. Her abdomen is nondistended, soft, and\nnontender. No guarding and no peritoneal signs. Her skin is\nremarkable for healing superficial ulcers on the right heel. On\nthe left heel, she has a superficial ulcer with a dark eschar,\nwhich is approximately 4 x 4 cm in diameter. There is no\npurulent discharge around the area; however, the skin of the left\nfoot is fairly violaceous and warm on the plantar surface of the\nfoot surrounding the ulcer extending up the lateral aspect of the\nfoot to the anterior aspect of the left ankle was demarcated in\nthe Emergency Department. There is no other break in the skin\nvisualized. Her back is nontender with full range of motion.\nExtremities are remarkable for lower extremity atrophy. She does\nhave 1+ edema of both feet. She has minimal sensation on\npalpation of her feet with no obvious tenderness on palpation\nover her left foot. Her pulses are trace. She is alert and\noriented x3, has a depressed affect. See the PA note for\nremainder of the details of the physical examination.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient had IV access\ninitiated. Laboratory studies were sent including blood\ncultures. She was started on IV antibiotics, vancomycin, and\ngentamicin and was consulted to Vascular Surgery. Her feet\nremained elevated. She had a plain x-ray performed of her foot,\nwhich showed no obvious evidence of osteomyelitis and no\nsubcutaneous gas. Her laboratory studies are remarkable for\nhyperglycemia and she was started on IV fluids.\nDISPOSITION: She is admitted to Surgery.\nDIAGNOSIS: Left foot, nonhealing ulcer with left foot\ncellulitis, and peripheral vascular disease.\nSee the note for details.\n\nGRAHAM, ANGELA M.D.\nD: 08\/16\/92\nT: 08\/16\/92\nDictated By: GRAHAM, ANGELA\neScription document:3-3296461 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2092-10-26\nSECTIONS OF THIS NOTE WERE CREATED WITH A 'COPY AND PASTE' ACTION.

She has an extremely complicated history of R and now L. foot infections and ulcerations, in setting of here severe neuropathy and DM. She originally sustained a R. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, with poor union, and subsequent fracture of her 2nd &#8211; 4th metatarsals. She developed a chronic ulcerated callus over her R. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis&#8212;this did not improve despite multiple courses of antibiotics. She underwent I+D of her R. foot ulceration in 12\/89, OR cultures grew P. aeruginosa. In 3\/90, she underwent debridement of her chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting. In 6\/90, she underwent deep debridement of her ongoing 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, along with excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;bone cultures grew MSSA. She did well until 2\/92, when she underwent R. ankle revision for an equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot (calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and Achilles lengthening). She subsequently developed a R. heel ulceration, and in 4\/92, underwent debridement of this ulceration, removal of a screw, and placement of a vacuum sponge. Her wound continued to heal poorly, and she underwent R. SFA to posterior tibial bypass grafting. In 7\/92, she underwent debridement of her R. heel wound and placement of a full thickness skin graft, which has taken well; she feels that her R. heel has been healing nicely. During her long hospitalization in 4\/92, she started developing L. heel and L. forefoot ulcerations. She attributes the heel ulcerations to chronic pressure from her position in bed, and the forefoot ulcerations to the boots that were used to relieve her heel pressure, which apparently abraded her forefoot chronically. These ulcerations continued to worsen over the next few months, and she presented with cellulitis of this area in 8\/92. She received vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl initially, then augmentin, with persistent poor healing of her wounds. On 9\/10, she underwent operative debridement of her L. plantar heel ulcer&#8212;she was found to have extensive necrotic yellow-brown tissue underlying her L. heel eschar, which was extensively debrided; she received a course of linezolid postoperatively. She had an angiogram on 9\/12, which showed no significant flow limiting lesions in her LLE, and good flow through her prior R. SFA to posterior tibial bypas graft. She feels that her wounds have been healing fairly well recently; she feels that her R. heel is almost completely healed, and that her L. heel ulcer is smaller than it was previously. Her L. forefoot ulcer is also more shallow than it was in the past. Over the past 2-3 days, she developed fairly acute swelling, erythema, and pain around her forefoot ulcer, with erythema spreading to the dorsal surface of her foot. She was seen in vascular surgery clinic, and was admitted for antibiotics and further debridement. She has a chronic &#8216;fast heartbeat,&#8217; denies any systemic symptoms (no fevers, chills, sweats, notable weight changes), headaches, sinus symptoms, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in her bowel movements, dysuria, frequency, LE edema, rashes, myalgias, or new arthralgias. She feels that her foot erythema has improved significantly overnight with vancomycin.\nPMH:\npoorly controlled type I DM since age 12&#8212;complicated by diabetic retinopathy s\/p bilateral vitrectomies for retinal hemorrhage, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic nephropathy (gastroparesis)&#8212;on an insulin pump chronic foot ulcerations, initially R, now L, requiring numerous antibiotic courses and operative interventions:\n2083: R. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, poor union, subsequent fracture of the remainder of her R. metarsals chronic ulcerated callus over R. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis, no improvement despite multiple courses of antibiotics 12\/89: I+D of R. foot ulceration&#8212;cultures grew P. aeruginosa 3\/90: debridement of chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting 6\/90: deep debridement of her 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;cultures grew MSSA 2\/92: calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and Achilles lengthening for equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot 4\/92: subsequent development of R. heel ulceration, s\/p debridement of her ulceration, removal of a screw, vacuum sponge placement 4\/92: R.

Amanda Qualls, M.D.\n\n* Record date: 2092-12-26\nDiabetes CONSULT REPORT\n\nCC Asked by Dr. Katz to see the patient for assistance with management of hyperglycemia.\nHPI This is a 50 year old male patient with a history of type 1 diabetes diagnosed 40 years ago at an age of 10. Pt was initially treated with insulin and has been requiring insulin since diagnosis. Pt was started on an insulin pump in 2079. Current basal rates are 0.6 units from 12am-6am, 0.7 units from 6am to 6:30pm and then 0.6 units at 6:30pm again. Pt uses a carb ratio of 10:1. Pt cannot recall her correction factor as it is programmed into her pump. Monitors her blood glucoses at least 4 times per day and reports variable glucoses for 70->200. Reports hypoglycemic episodes 1-2 times per week and she is usually symptomatic with glucoses of 70. Reports that she was admitted to the hospital about one month ago with DKA. States that she had flu-like symptoms and severe vomiting and was admitted ot Ames Pathology Center for treatment. Had never had DKA before. Pt reports complications associated with diabetes. Reports retinopathy and has had several laster surgeries. Reports nephropathy as well as an episode of renal failure related to a hospitalization this summer. Reports peripheral neuropathy as well as peripheral vascular disease, including non-healing ulcers that have lead to right TMA.\nPatient is admitted for stenosis of right bypass graft stenosis and is going to the cath lab for angiogram shortly. Currently receiving D5W with 150 meq of Bicarb at 125 ccs\/hr for renal protection. BG today (with IV fluid infusing): 230 (4am), 271 (9am), and 195 (11am - prior to leaving for cath) BG 12\/25: 152 (1pm), 196 (6pm), 172 (8pm) Pt is using her insulin pump. Allergies Erythromycins - rash Sulfa - rash Aspirin - rash\n\nMedications Diabetes medications at home included: Insulin pump, see HPI Diabetes medications now include: Insulin pump\nProblems Anemia Anxiety Deep venous thrombosis Depression Hypothyroidism Palpitations Right TMA Let ankle fracture FHX No history of hormonal disorders in any family members SHX and Habits Non-smoker ROS Patient is post-operative.\nPhysical Examination General: Patient is in no apparent distress. Vitals: BP 110\/60, HR 99, Temp HENT: Inspection reveals no abnormalities. Eyes: Conjunctivae, sclera and lids are normal. No icterus. Respiratory: Assessment of respiratory effort reveals even respirations without use of accessory muscles Skin: No skin rash, warm and dry skin. No acanthosis nigricans. Neurological Examination: Alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. Grossly nonfocal exam. Psychiatric: Mood and affect appropriate to situation. Extremity exam: No pedal edema, right foot with bandage.\nLab Results 12\/25\/2092 NA 136, K 4.5, CL 107, CO2 22 (*), BUN 52 (*), CRE 2.11 (*), EGFR 25, GLU 212 (*)12\/02\/2092 HGBA1C 9.0 (H)12\/25\/2092 WBC 6.55, RBC 4.34 (#), HGB 10.5 (*#), HCT 33.5 (*#), MCV 77.2 (*#), MCH 24.2 (*), MCHC 31.4 (*), PLT 302 (#) Assessment T1DM - Uncontrolled. Pt appears alert, oriented and confident to use her insulin pump in the hospital. Pt is able to verbalize her insulin doses and states that she would prefer to continue with pump use. Suspect that IV fluids are contributing to hyperglycemia, therefore reluctant to change insulin doses since IV fluids will likely stop later today. While in procedure, will need to monitor blood glucoses more closely, but anticipate that pump can continue as programmed.\nRecommendations 1. Continue with insulin pump. Instructed pt that she must: a. report all pre-meal bolus doses to the RN so that it can be documented on the flow sheet. b. have blood glucoses checked as ordered using the hospital approved glucose meter. c. alert RN if she feel uncomfortable using insulin pump. RN should page HO and\/or diabetes dept immediately for orders for SC insulin. d. agree to discontinue insulin pump and start SC insulin if deemed necessary by house staff. Pt agrees to all of the above. 2. Monitor blood glucoses at least before all meals and at bedtime. Please also check blood glucoses with any symptoms of hypoglycemia or at pt's request. Be sure to record these values on the daily flow sheet. 3. For procedure today, I spoke with Kathryn Kincaid and asked that blood glucoses be monitored hourly while in cath lab unless BG is less than 140. If BG less than 140, monitor blood glucoses every 30 minutes. Treat BG less than 80 with 1\/2 amp D50 and continue to monitor as described above. Do not remove insulin pump.

She underwent R femoral to posterior tibial bypass graft in 5\/92 and skin grafting in 7\/92. R heel wound subsequently improved but pt developed L plantar ulceration requiring debridement 10\/92. Cultures grew MSSA. Pt was subsequently treated w\/ extended course of doxycycline, rifampin through 2\/93. She subsequently did well until developing R heel ulcer while undergoing psychiatric hospitalization in mid 2\/94. She was initially hospitalized at Altadena Hospital, where she underwent debridement of wound and treatment w\/ extended course of penicillin VK and probenicid. Wound failed to improve. Pt was rehospitalized on 3\/18 at GCCfor further management. She underwent incision and debridement on 3\/18. Intraoperative evaluation revealed ulcer wound tracking to bone. Intraoperative gram stain revealed GPCs in pairs. Intraoperative cultures are pending.

End-stage renal disease. Because of her original end-stage renal disease was reportedly FSGS, she had a preemptive transplant in 2068, which was complicated by rejection and ultimate loss of the graft. She resumed dialysis in 2072. She had a second transplant in 2075, which was also complicated and ultimately rejected. She resumed hemodialysis in 2082. She does have a match with her only daughter, but apparently the Transplant Service feels that she would not be a good candidate and I think she would be reluctant to go through two surgeries, which would be required, one to remove the old graft and one for the new transplant. She currently is dialyzed at the Overbrook Hospital. Her dialysis physician is Dr. Lemus. 2. Hypertension. 3. Peripheral vascular disease. She had an angiogram in 2083 at LMC and an MRA in 2085, which showed bilateral iliac and femoral artery stenoses. She apparently does not have claudication despite this. 4. History of right foot-drop. She had a severe episode of shingles in 2077 with associated sciatica and foot-drop. 5. History of hemorrhoids for at least six years with occasional bleeding and with anal protrusion. 6. History of CMV colitis in 08\/2081. 7. Secondary hyperparathyroidism. She is on Sensipar and has been on this since early 2085.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She had a supracervical hysterectomy for benign disease in 2061 and a left salpingo-oophorectomy for a serous cyst in 04\/2082. She is status post appendectomy. She is status post bilateral cataract surgery.\nMEDICATIONS: Norvasc 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d, Lipitor 40 mg per day, aspirin 81 mg per day, Nephrocaps 1 mg per day, Restoril 15 mg nightly, Hectorol 4 mcg per 2 mL three times per week, B6 200 mg per day, vitamin E 400 mg per day, flaxseed oil 1000 mg per day and B12 4000 mcg per day.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Significant for diabetes in her father and grandfather, negative for cancer.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She is a widow. She is a lifetime nonsmoker. She does not drink alcohol or use drugs. She is a retired mathematician at Vassar. She came from Turlock 10 years ago to Pecos to be with her daughter who is a surgeon in the area. She never has felt the Pecos as home and is home sick for Turlock.\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She has had some problems with left shoulder pain and immobility. She generally seems to be somewhat overwhelmed and a little bit sad. She seems never to have adjusted to life in Pecos. She has had the loss of two the kidney transplants and then the foot-drop, which has made walking difficult. She did have a brace at one time, which helped her to walk, but it was irritating. She had seen Dr. Yim to get another one, but that never worked out. She did not complain of any chest pain or shortness of breath, no constipation. She does have hemorrhoids that are active as above.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a well-developed, well-nourished, very pleasant, but somewhat sad-appearing white female. Her blood pressure is 140\/60. HEENT, pupils equal, round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Throat is clear. Neck, supple, no adenopathy or thyromegaly. Heart, regular rate and rhythm. Lungs, clear. Abdomen, soft, nontender, no organomegaly. Extremities, no edema. Neuro, absent reflex in the right patella and 2+ in the left patella.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. End-stage renal disease on dialysis, not considered to be a transplant candidate at this time as she has had two rejections. 2. Hypertension, well controlled on medications. 3. Hyperlipidemia, on Lipitor. Last cholesterol was checked in 10\/2086 with normal ALT and AST, but elevated alkaline phosphatase. 4. Peripheral vascular disease, currently asymptomatic. 5. Right foot-drop. We may look into getting her another brace perhaps another consult with Dr. Yim. 6. Left shoulder pain. It did mention in her physical, but she can only abduct her left shoulder to about 90 degrees without pain. We may look into this further and perhaps get some physical therapy for possible rotator cuff tendinitis. 7. Hemorrhoids. 8. Secondary hyperparathyroidism on Sensipar. 9. Health maintenance. Mammogram was done in 06\/2086. Pap smear was done in 04\/2083. Colonoscopy was done in 08\/2081. 10? Depression. She seemed a little sad. Has had a tough time with her medical problems and never adjusted that well to Pecos. Will have her come back and discuss further.\nQiana Solomon, MD\n\n\neScription document:9-2784353 KUQlhv Egq\n\nDD: 03\/06\/87 DT: 03\/07\/87 DV: 03\/06\/87\n\n* Record date: 2089-03-29\nInternal Medicine INTERN ADMISSION NOTE PATIENT FH MRN: 57585291 ATTENDING: Dr. Olivia Perry PRIMARY CARE: Dr. Qiana Solomon, Emmons Health Counseling Center, 665-578-7821 HCP: Quanita-Ella Paul-Doyle (daughter),: 448-876-4285\nCC: Left thigh pain, inability to ambulate\nHPI: 77F with ESRD (secondary to FSGS) on HD (Monday,Wednesday,Friday) s\/p two failed renal transplants (2068, 2075), severe lumbar spinal stenosis and left thigh tendonitis presenting with worsening of chronic left thigh pain and inability to ambulate x3 days.\nPatient with a history of left thigh pain since 6\/2088.

He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB. Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts. He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed. Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms. Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD. There was no PCI option available.\nHe has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted. Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic. He now presented for cath.\nToday he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch. The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease up to 80%. The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis. LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM. RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG. The LIMA-> D1 is patent and the SVG-> RCA is patent. The SVG-> LAD is not visualized. The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA\/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent. He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress.\nPast Medical History CAD CABG x 3 2092 (LIMA-> LAD, SVG-> LAD, SVG-> RCA) Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Diabetes Anxiety\/depression\nAllergies ACE-i-> cough Diovan-> fatigue Zocor, crestor-> myalgias Metformin-> GI intolerance\nSocial History Married, 4 children Lives with wife Retired floor covering installer, works for son doing accounting\nHabits ETOH: 3 drinks\/week on average Smoking: quit 30 yrs ago Caffeine: 5-6\/day (coffee and diet coke) Diet: diabetic Exercise: unable to do much d\/t symptoms\nFamily History\n7 sbilings with HTN Father with heart problems- died at 86\nMedications At Home:\nImdur 60 mg QD Ranexa 1000 mg BID Lasix 20 mg QD Lipitor 40 mg QD Plavix 75 mg QD Lexapro 10 mg QD Lopressor 12.5 mg BID Protonix 40 mg QD KCL 10 mEq QD ECASA 325 mg QD Norvasc 10 mg QD Ambien 10 mg QD\n\nPhysical Exam Height: 67 Weight: 180 lbs\nVS: 100\/50, 63, 18 Monitor: SR\/SB\nGen: well appearing caucasian male in NAD\nNeuro: alert, oriented x 3, speech clear and articulate.

Cardiac catheterization was performed in Jan 93 and underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved. He was admitted to ODC in May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA\/ Taxus stent. He had symptomatic relief until about one month ago when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen. He presented today for cath which revealed a new stenosis distal to the prior LAD stent which was patent. The lesion was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent. he is now admitted to the Cardiology department for post procedure monitoring and arrived to cardio clinic pain free and hemodynamically stable.\nPast medical history: DM HTN Hyperlipidemia CAD -CABG x 3 September 2092 WMMC (LIMA to D2, SVG to RCA, SVG to LAD) s\/p PCI prox LAD Jan 2093, s\/p Taxus stent to LAD 5\/94 GERD s\/p H pylori eradication several years ago Left rotator cuff injury s\/p CABG Anxiety hernia repair\n\nChanges to Allergies ACE Inhibitor - reaction: cough [reviewed] METFORMIN - reaction: GI Intolerance [reviewed] ROSUVASTATIN - reaction: myalgia [reviewed] SIMVASTATIN - reaction: myalgias [reviewed] VALSARTAN - reaction: fatigue [reviewed]\nSocial history: Lives with wife in Lagrange,KS.

He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis. He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication. His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper.\nHe felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea. On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness. He described the chest tightness as like someone sitting on his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder. This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted. The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths. He also began to have a non-productive cough this same day. This was the first time he has ever experienced this chest discomfort and shortness of breath. He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, acid reflux sensation, PND, orthopnea, fever or sick contacts.\n\nED Course:\nVitals: T: 97.9 BP: 195\/115 HR: 84 RR: 28 Sat: 95-96% on RA\nInterventions:\n1.5-2.0L NS\nKayexcelate 45mg PO\nASA 325mg\nNorvasc 5mg PO\nNexium 40mg PO\nToprol 100mg PO\nLopressor 5mg IV\nMorphine sulfate 1mg IV\nMSO4 1mg IV\nStudies:\nK+=5.6 (9\/06\/62 5:02AM)\nEKG: see Data section\nCXR: see Data section\n\nPast Medical\/Surgical History:\nDiabetes Mellitus: dx 18 years ago, used Insulin in past, has only used for 1-2 weeks in\npast year, last HgbA1c 5.4 (8\/17\/62), complications include peripheral neuropathy, retinal disease, gastroparesis and numerous LE ulcers\nHypertension: initially labeled as labile hypertension, SBP's often in 190's-200's, on\nmultiple medical regimens in past\nChronic renal failure: creatinine >1.5 starting in 9\/61\nHepatitis C: viral load >1,000,000 in 2\/22, thought to be acquired through sexual contact,\ndenies IV drug use\n\nAllergies:\nReglan- dystonia\n\nMedications:\nHCTZ 25mg PO QD\nLisinopril 20mg PO QD\nToprol XL 100mg PO QD\nNorvasc 5mg PO BID\nNeurontin 600mg PO QD\nProtonix 40 mg PO QD\nInsulin?

His initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure. He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema. However, his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema. His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event. His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including CHF, drug toxicity (lisinopril and NSAIDs), DM-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.\n\nProblem List and Plan:\nSOB\/Chest tightness:\n--continue to cycle enzymes for R\/O\n-CXR AP and lateral to assess presence of pulmonary edema\n-TTE\n-diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV\n-Hydralazine 10mg QID & Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID\n-d\/c Lisinopril\n-continue O2 at 2L, monitor O2 sat\n-monitor ins and outs, daily weights\n-obtain lipid panel to assess CAD risk factors and need for statin\nRenal failure: acute over chronic, baseline nephropathy due to DM and HTN, history of\n+protein in urine, urine sediment spun, no signs of active sediment\n-urinary electrolytes to measure FENa\n-d\/c Lisinopril\n-dose Neurontin according to renal function\n-consider ruling out renal artery stenosis\n-obtain urinary eosinophils to evaluate for interstitial nephritis\nHypertension: hypertensive emergency considered, but determined to be unlikely due to\nchronity of elevated SBP at similar values, under treatment\n-continue Toprol XL 100mg QD, Norvasc 5mg BID\n-add Hydralazine 10mg QID, Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID\n-monitor BP and signs and symptoms of target organ damage closely\nOpioid withdrawal\/pain management:\n-Morphine PRN\n-consult pain service\nDM:\n-sliding scale insulin\n-obtain Insulin and C peptide levels because unclear if currently taking Insulin\nProphylaxis:\n-20mg Nexium PO QD\n-Heparin 5000 units SC BID\n\nUdo O.

She is currently maintained on furosemide 20 mg. PO q.d, nifedipine XL 90 mg. PO q.d, and potassium chloride 10 ml. equivalents PO q.d. Patient comes in today for a routine follow up of her blood pressure, as well as routine baseline examinations. On her last visit, her blood pressure was 160\/90, and on check today it was 150\/90. We discussed the possibility that she continue her salt-restricted diet. We also discussed that she continue her own exercise, both of which she does faithfully, and we also discussed the possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight. She currently weighs 199 lbs. and stands approximately 4'9 tall. As far as long-term prognosis, my current plan is to evaluate her blood pressure on another subsequent visit in the next 6-8 weeks and at that time if it is elevated, we will consider either going up on her nifedipine XL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine, seeing if we can possibly gain some better control or possibly adding another agent. However, at this point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure and this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood pressure on her first admission, which was systolic blood pressures in the 200s-190s. Her family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation now appears to be much more stable. She is currently living with her mother and she says that she she is enjoying her new sense of feeling good about her self with regard to exercise and maintenance of her diet. PHYSICAL EXAM: BP: 150\/90 Lungs: clear bilaterally. Heart: RRR, no murmurs. Abdomen: distended, obese, no evidence of HSM or any focal tenderness. She had good pulses distally with no evidence of trace swelling bilaterally at the ankles. Breast exam: no evidence of masses or lumps. She will follow up with me in 6-8 weeks, at which time she will have a mammogram performed as well as a Pap smear, cholesterol test, and stool guaiacs. Advance directives were not discussed and it is not a pertinent issue at this point. Quinton Lovett, M.D. EF:AW:0810 DD:1-31-75 DT:2-01-75 DV:1-31-75 * Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider *\n\n* Record date: 2076-08-23\nPMH INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES William-Nuel, Kelli 89897856 8-23-76 HPI: Mrs. William-Nuel is a 61-year old patient of mine who carries a diagnosis of essential hypertension and comes in today for a routine checkup. Patient appears to be doing fine. She has been compliant with her antihypertensive regimen, which consists of nifedipine and also hydrochlorothiazide. Since our last meeting, the patient has lost approximately 15 to 20 pounds. She has been exercising on a daily basis and eating very well, both of which have had very, very significant and beneficial results on her blood pressure and pressure today on examination was 120\/80 in both arms. The patient was complaining of some ankle swelling, and in looking through her medicines I noted that she had been on furosemide, which was a holdover from the time of her most recent admission. I quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide, which I feel would give her much better diuretic response and relief of her symptoms over the next few days. The final issue with the patient today is low back pain, which she has had chronically for the last several years after suffering a fall in 2065. We have tried a whole host of conservative measures, which have included bed rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and back exercises. The patient is referred now to the Paoli Memorial Hospital Spinal Clinic for services to obtain further help, and hopefully treatment, of her pain. Treatment recommendations from the Spinal Clinic will be forthcoming. Patient is scheduled to follow up with me again in two to three months. ADDENDUM: The issue of her annual screening was addressed also and patient agreed to have her cholesterol checked today, but does not want to have either a mammogram or a Pap smear. She complains that she does not have faith in these procedures and that this is something that she is not used to and does not want to have done. I attempted to discuss the need and why it is necessary to undergo continued screening and will continue to do this with the patient in the future, but for now, the patient adamantly refuses either of the two examinations.

The PRESENTING COMPLAINT, HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT, PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES, SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, and REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As noted on the record by Dr. Uehara, and as reviewed with the patient and with Dr. Uehara. Briefly, the patient is a pleasant 64-year-old woman, who has had episodes of severe left-sided pressure-like chest pain off and on through the course of this week. This has occurred with exertion and has always cleared with rest. She is pain-free at present, but presents to the Emergency Department because she reported to her family that she had ceased taking her high blood pressure medications. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The physical examination is as noted by Dr. Uehara. Basically, the examination is completely normal with the exception of the blood pressure, which ranges from 220 to 230 over 100 to 110. The patient's electrocardiogram does not show acute changes. LABORATORY EVALUATION: The cardiac troponin I is 0.53. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: I concur with Dr. Uehara that the patient has a strong history for unstable angina. The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. She has remained pain-free while in the Emergency Department and has received nitroglycerin paste. Her blood pressure will be treated with initiation of an ACE inhibitor. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Unstable angina. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): The patient is admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition. IZ329\/1982 STEPHEN X.

She continues to do well and had an LDL of 90 in March. We will recheck it again today. She has no significant chest discomfort and is doing all of her activities. She has no syncope or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She is tolerating her medications quite well and is happy with her progress. At home she takes her blood pressure and it's generally around 120\/80. Current medications are one aspirin per day as well as Isordil 20 mg. t.i.d, Labetalol 400 mg. t.i.d, Norvasc 7.5 mg. q.d, Lipitor 80 mg. q.d. and Glipizide. She has not used sublingual Nitroglycerin although she has this. Her blood pressure today is 128\/80 and her heart rate is 50 and regular. Chest is clear. Cardiac exam reveals a II\/VI left sternal border systolic ejection murmur. Abdomen is soft and nontender. Extremities are free of edema. Ms. Kelli Westyn-Nuel is doing well. We will check her LDL again today to make sure it did not rebound to a higher level following her myocardial infarction. We will also check her liver function test because of her statin therapy. We may in the future need to adjust her nitrates to a more rational once per day regimen, but her current situation is so stable that we will leave her medications as is. Spencer O.

She was last here in February with no complaints, but did have an elevated creatinine for which she was referred to the Internal Medicine for further evaluation. The patient did not, however, present to the Internal Medicine as planned. She states that she has been too busy. Her only complaint today is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is relieved to some extent by acetaminophen. Eva continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day. A noted in her ambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d. drug, however, Eva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than on an almost p.r.n. basis. Review of systems is essentially normal. Specifically, she denies any headaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath. She also denies any symptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract. She has no history of dysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria. Physical Examination: She is robust appearing. Vital signs are significant for a blood pressure of 140\/100. HEENT exam is unremarkable. Lungs are clear. Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal S1, S2. No S3 is appreciated. There are no murmurs or rubs. Abdomen is slightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds. No masses are appreciated. Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not suggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion. Indeed, exam of her legs is entirely unremarkable. Laboratory: Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine sediment and a urine creatinine. Assessment and Plan: 1. Hypertension: Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure on her Procardia. I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day. I will see her in a few days in order to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug and also to check her blood pressure once again. 2. Right leg pain: This would appear to be chronic and may well be related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.) I have asked her to continue taking Tylenol and we will re-evaluate her need for more powerful agents, such as nonsteroidals if the need arises. PROMPTCARE INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES Rutledge, Eva Page 2 29195561 6-19-59 3. Elevated creatinine: Unfortunately, Eva has not kept her Renal appointment. In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong. She is to see him on the 29th of this month at 1:00 p.m. and I have also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him. Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney function. 4. Health Maintenance: The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear today, but again was too busy to stay that long. She is to see me again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time. Her February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and will not be repeated until next year.

She is currently on procardia xl, losartan, and atenolol for her hypertension. She takes a baby aspirin qd for cardiac protection. Her diabetes is controlled by diet alone, and her GERD by zantac 150 qd or bid prn. Her last HbA1C was 6.9, with a malb\/cr ratio of 222.2 and trace protein on U\/A. She has had a prior cardiac work-up for atypical chest pain with a negative ETT\/SPECT in 2062 and a negative ETT in 2064. An echo in 2062 showed an EF of 65% with no valvular abnormalities.\n\nShe is currently well with no complaints. She is being followed in opthalmology for possible glaucoma. She does not check her blood sugars at home, although she has a glucometer. When asked if her sugars are ever low, she states that she has the same symptoms with hypoglycemia that she does with hyperglycemia: dizziness and hot flashes. She's not had this recently. She also does not check her BP at home. She denies any numbness or tingling in her fingers, or any chest pain. She did pull a muscle in her shoulder last night and still feels tender in that area. She follows a diabetic diet (avoids sweets), gets no regular exercise, but works in Electrical and Avionics Mechanics so does have physical activity during the day.\n\nPSHx: none\nPGynHx: G7 P4 SAB1 TAB2, still menstruating q month, no hot flashes, heavy periods but no clots; LMP 10\/01\/66\nAllergies: NKAD\nHabits: never smoked, very rare EtOH, no illicit drugs\n\nMedications:\nASA 81MG PO QD\nATENOLOL 100MG PO QD (she has run out of this and did not take it today)\nPROCARDIA XL 30MG PO QD\nRANITIDINE HCL 150MG PO QD\nLOSARTAN 50MG PO 2 qd\n\nPhysical Exam\n================ Vital signs ================\nBlood Pressure: -- 136\/76\nPulse: -- 76\nWeight: -- 139 [Pounds]\nGeneral: no acute distress\nHEENT: PERLA, anicteric, O\/P clear\nNeck: no thyromegaly or LAN; no carotid bruits\nChest: lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no crackles\nHeart: regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 normal, no m\/g\/r\nAbd: soft, NT\/ND. +BS.

Diabetes. Checking A1C off medication. Would like to have patient check FS when she's feeling ill or if A1C is elevated. Will refer to NP for review glucometer use, diabetic diet. She has been tried on glucotrol XL in the past and was hypoglycemia. This is also probably not a good choice due to her renal insufficiency. May try glyburide if A1C elevated. Being followed by opthalmology with upcoming appt. Podiatry referral deferred. Consider repeat referral to nutrition. Lipids very good (LDL 82) last check off medication.\n2. Hypertension. BP borderline elevated today, but off atenolol. HR also up. Refilled all meds; will ask NP to check her pressure at next visit. Will continue qd ASA for CAD\/stroke prevention.\n3. GERD. Continue zantac bid as needed. Also recommended that patient start using Tums for calcium supplementation and relief of intermittent dyspepsia. She will try this and get back to me about the effect.\n4. Chronic renal insufficiency. Will get 24-hour urine to assess creatinine clearance and urine protein. Checking chem 7 today for K and Creatinine.\n5. Health maintenance. Patient due to dT shot, requested today. Normal mammogram in 5\/66.

In addition, I personally\ninterviewed and examined this patient.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65-year-old female who\npresents for evaluation of chest pain. The patient had no\nhistory of coronary artery disease until the last week. She was\napparently in Pennsylvania where she had been for the last week. She\nhad been having 5 days of epigastric and substernal discomfort.\nShe considered it to be indigestion and have been taking Tums.\nAfter approximately 5 days while in Pennsylvania, she felt that the\ndiscomfort was not improving. She did feel like that she had\nless energy for her usual activity. She went to a hospital there\nin her land of Pennsylvania where she was noted to have a positive\ntroponin. She underwent a diagnostic catheterization that did\nshow multivessel disease with an occluded LAD. She subsequently\nunderwent a therapeutic PCI with stenting of her LAD. She did\nhave recurrent chest pain today after catheterization, which was\nmuch more severe, sharper in nature per her description. She was\ntold in the hospital in Pennsylvania that this was due to reperfusion.\nShe returned home today, called her primary care physician and\nwas advised to come to the Emergency Department for evaluation.\nShe does state that since discharge from the hospital in Pennsylvania\nearlier this week, she has had intermittent episodes of more\nsevere left anterior chest pain, which she describes as somewhat\nmore sharp than the indigestion feeling she was experiencing\nbefore. It is not always associated with exertion. It sometimes\nradiates to her left shoulder. It is not pleuritic in nature.\nIt seems to be intermittent, although she does have a low level\nof dull aching pain, which has been fairly constant since her\ndischarge from Pennsylvania. She denies any shortness of breath. She\nis able to lie flat. Denies any lower extremity edema.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Positive for type 1 diabetes, which is\nfairly brittle per her report. She is status post MI within the\nlast week. She also has a remote history of PE in the past and\nis no longer on Coumadin.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke. She lives with her husband\nand has recently returned from Pennsylvania.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Reviewed and is also positive for CAD.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: All other systems are reviewed and are also\nnegative except per the HPI.\nMEDICATIONS: Include insulin, Plavix, aspirin, Nexium, Lipitor,\nand atenolol.\nALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to iodine and Indocin.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 65,\nrespirations 18, and blood pressure 105\/69. The patient is\nawake, alert, pleasant female who is reclining in no acute\ndistress. Her head examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.\nHer pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her sclerae are\nanicteric. Her conjunctivae are pink and moist. She has moist\nmucous membranes and appears well hydrated. Her neck is supple\nand nontender with full range of motion. The JVP is not\nelevated. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with\nequal breath sounds, no respiratory distress. No accessory\nmuscle use and no chest wall tenderness. Her cardiac examination\nis regular rate and rhythm with no murmur, rub, or gallop. Her\nabdomen is nondistended, soft, and nontender. No guarding, no\nperitoneal signs, and no organomegaly. Her skin is intact, warm,\ndry, and slightly pale. There are no rashes. Her back is\nnontender with full range of motion. Extremities reveal no\ncyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Her calves are soft and nontender\nwith no palpable cords and full range of motion with normal\nstrength and tone. She is alert and oriented x3, very pleasant.\nCranial nerves are intact, and there is no motor or sensory\ndeficit. Rectal examination performed by the resident reveals\nheme-negative stool with normal tone.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was placed on a cardiac\nmonitor. IV access was maintained. Laboratory studies were sent\nand EKG was also ordered. Her prior records from Pennsylvania were\nreviewed. Her white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 37, and\nplatelets 285,000. Her electrolytes are within normal limits.\nHer BUN is 18, creatinine 0.8, and glucose 112. Her CK here\nreturned normal at 33. Her MB was 0.4. Her troponin returned\nelevated at 0.39. This is in comparison to the troponin from her\nrecords of Pennsylvania, which was 0.2. Her d-dimer is less than 200.\nHer INR is 1.1. The patient had an EKG, which showed evidence\nof a new T-wave inversions, present on prior EKG from this\nhospital. She was started on heparin for concern of unstable\nangina status post MI, remained hemodynamically stable, and is\nadmitted to the Cardiac Service.\nDIAGNOSIS: Chest pain, rule out unstable angina.\n\nCONNER, VICKIE M.D.\nD: 11\/08\/85\nT: 11\/08\/85\nDictated By: CONNER, VICKIE\neScription document:6-4710513 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2085-12-07\n\nZASTROW, IRENE 42521583 12\/07\/2085\nDATE OF ADMISSION: 12\/06\/2085.\nThis 66-year-old woman phoned my office complaining of exertional chest discomfort. We instructed her to presented to the Emergency Department at Davis Monthan Hospital. She had experienced multiple episodes of chest pressure with exertion lasting 5-10 minutes and radiating to her left axilla.\nOn 10\/30\/2085, she suffered non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in Pennsylvania and was managed with percutaneous coronary intervention.\nChest discomfort recurred and on 11\/03\/2085, she was recatheterized at Davis Monthan Hospital where her mid LAD stent was expanded.\nShe has had worsening substernal chest discomfort over the past two to three days. Her discomfort is relieved with nitroglycerin. Overnight, she had on and off chest discomfort with anterior T-wave lability. She was placed on intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin.\nShe suffered pulmonary embolism in 2074. That is when I first met her. She has gastroesophageal reflux disease.\nShe is married; her husband works at 24 Hour Fitness as a personal trainer in the weight room. She does not smoke cigarettes. She has four children.\nHome medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 80 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, insulin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.\nThe review of systems is negative other than the above.\nOn physical examination, she appears well.

The legs have no clubbing or cyanosis, but there is right leg greater than left leg edema. The skin has no rash.\nMy assessment is that Irene Zastrow has small vessel coronary artery disease in addition to epicardial coronary artery disease. We will intensify her medical regimen by prescribing higher doses of beta blockade and by initiating a long-acting nitrate. We will also repeat the chest CT scan to make sure she has not suffered from recurrent pulmonary embolism.\nI discussed this plan with her, her husband, and the medical house staff.\nVictor Z.

At that time, she had a drug-eluting stent placed in her left anterior descending coronary artery. On 11\/03\/2085, she had repeat percutaneous coronary intervention because of persistent chest pain and required an additional inflation and reexpansion of the drug-eluting stent. On 12\/07\/2085, she had repeated cardiac catheterization because of chest pain but no additional percutaneous coronary intervention was required.\n\nShe feels that she is having less chest discomfort as we have ramped up her cardiac medications. She has no shortness of breath. She does get occasional abdominal pulsations. She does get epigastric discomfort.\n\nCurrent medications include ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, aspirin 325 mg once daily, Plavix 75 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and insulin.\n\nThe review of systems is negative other than the above.\n\nOn physical examination, she appears well. Weight 165 pounds, blood pressure 109\/73 mmHg, heart rate 77 and regular, respiratory rate 14. HEENT: Normal. The neck veins are not distended. The chest is clear. On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop. Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly. The legs have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. The skin has no rash.\n\nIrene Zastrow is improving from the clinical cardiovascular view point.\n\nI will obtain an exercise treadmill test using the standard Bruce protocol to obtain additional objective data.\n\nAlthough theoretically she should not have acid secretion due to pernicious anemia, I do suspect she has acid reflux, and I am reinstituting today Prilosec 20 mg twice daily.\n\nI am prescribing physical therapy for her stiff neck.\n\nI am ordering an abdominal ultrasound to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm due to her complaint of episodic abdominal severe pulsations.\n\nI reassured her and told her she is clinically improving.

We have had heron the insulin pump now for close to six months and recently she had had continuous blood glucose monitoring. We had gone over these results over the phone and I had made some adjustments. Particularly she seems to have some late morning hyperglycemia and we decided to change her carbohydrate to bolus ratio during the morning hours and this has resulted in tremendous improvement in her blood sugars. She brings them in today and the results look excellent. She has had no other concerns of late. We have not tested her hemoglobin A1c in a long period of time, so she comes in today for further evaluation.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for the type I diabetes as described, her pernicious anemia, C6-C7 vertebral degenerative disease, pulmonary embolus and also some mild asthma in the past.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Prior surgeries are complete hysterectomy about 15 years ago and a single oophorectomy. Prior hospitalizations include her PEs in 2083, her tachycardia in 2083. She had arthroscopic right knee surgery approximately five years ago and she had four live births. She is currently in menopause.\nMEDICATIONS: Include Aleve 220 mg b.i.d. p.r.n. pain, aspirin 81 mg daily, calcium 600 mg plus vitamin D, she takes one tablet twice a day, Plavix 75 mg daily, glucagon emergency kit as needed, glucosamine 750 mg b.i.d. She has recently completed a Cipro course with Dr. Varney for bacterial overgrowth symptoms, Imdur 30 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg nightly, multivitamin one tablet per day, ranolazine 1 g as directed, Toprol-XL 150 mg daily, vitamin B12 1500 mcg every month, and vitamin D2 1000 mg daily.\nALLERGIES: Include any iodine product she gets red and itchy skin.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke. She has never smoked. She drinks alcohol rarely, a glass of wine maybe once a week, one cup of soda with caffeine each day. She walks for exercise. Gardening is her major hobby. She lives with her husband.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Reveals her mother passed away at age 73 with malignancy, father passed away at age 89 with congestive heart failure with five bypasses, sister at age 73 with arthritis, a brother at age 70 with colon cancer and MI, sister age 68 has diabetes and Alzheimers, brother 63 years old in good health. Paternal grandmother passed away at age 89 and paternal grandfather at 52 from a massive MI. Paternal grandmother 53 from colon cancer, paternal grandfather at age 89. She has four children serious medical problems.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise unremarkable except for what is listed already in the HPI.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is generally awake, alert, in no acute distress. She is 66.5 inches with a weight of 167.5 pounds, which gives her a BMI of 26.7. Her blood pressure is 110\/62 and her pulse is 86. Generally, she is awake, alert, in no acute distress. HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic. Pupils equally round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Cranial nerves II through XII are symmetric and intact bilaterally. Fundi are unremarkable. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No dullness to percussion is present. Back exam reveals no spinal, paraspinal or CVA tenderness. Breast examination reveals no masses or galactorrhea. Cardiovascular exam, PMI in the mid clavicular line, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal exam: Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal masses noted. Anoscopy did not reveal any hemorrhoids. Neck exam reveals no jugular venous distention. Carotids are 2+ with normal upstrokes. Thyroid is 20 g without nodules. Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Neurologically, she is alert and oriented x3 and has a grossly nonfocal exam.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Ms. Zastrow is a 67-year-old woman who comes in today with review of her type 1 diabetes. She is doing much better on the pump than she was before especially with the recent adjustments we made. We will continue with the pump and she will continue to send me her blood sugars every two weeks until we get this under control. We will check a hemoglobin A1c today. She is up-to-date with the remainder of her health maintenance including seeing a podiatrist and an ophthalmologist as we had prescribed. 2. Cardiovascular. She is doing well on her current regimen. She is on ranolazine and will continue with this. 3. Neck pain. Intermittent neck pain is most likely from degenerative disease. I did not find anything on neurological exam that was concerning. I did encourage her to actually take some Naprosyn as needed for this pain, but not to take it on a continuous basis for long periods of time. She has had some problems with some blood in the stool and I feel that she is due for colonoscopy. I did recommend that she get one in the near future.\nADDENDUM: A pelvic exam was with normal appearing female external genitalia. Normal vaginal vault, no adnexal fullness felt. Vaginal Pap was taken. Greater than 50% of our 60-minute visit was spent going over her pump settings, the appropriate levels for her pump, going over her diet, going over her bowel habits and her etiology of possible blood in her stool.\nIva P Hall, MD\n\n\neScription document:9-9269277 CSSten Tel\n\nDD: 04\/19\/87 DT: 04\/19\/87 DV: 04\/07\/87\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2099-07-17\nKEKELA EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT LEON,MAURICE 436-34-21-1 VISIT DATE: 07\/17\/99 Patient seen on 7\/17\/99 by myself and the medical resident at 4:30 p.m. PRESENTING COMPLAINT: Chest wall pain.

I see no LMR note about the visit, but am told that he was given some medication for his BP, given some insulin and a Rx for insulin, and instructed to see his PCP the next day, and discharged. Friday he did see his PCP, who told him not to take insulin but to take oral DM meds instead, and told him to return to the ED b\/c he still had a terrible HA, so he came back to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ED tonight. He was given caffeine, ibuprofen, Tylenol, and compazine, reported that his HA was gone. However, a staff physician in the ED on exam noted a wide based gait. An MRI was originally ordered, but canceled when it came to notice that he has an implanted device to prevent syncope that precludes MRI. Neurology is now consulted.to comment on his gait and other sx.\n\nPatient and his wife tell me that his gait is baseline, and has been as it is for years; they have noticed no change and have no complaints.\nHe is very unpleasant and un-forthcoming about his history, slow to cooperate w\/ exam; says he wants to go home, resents being in the ED still now that his HA is gone.\n\nVS in ED tonight: BP 172\/95 max, but mostly 150-160s; temp 98, hr 89, 100% RA\nBlood glucose not measured tonight.\n\nROS:\nNegative for: changes in vision or hearing, neck pain, tinnitus, vertigo, weakness, numbness, difficulty with comprehension, speaking, language, swallowing, eating, balance or gait.\nGeneral review of systems negative for: fevers, chills, rashes, change in weight, energy level or appetite, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and change in bowel or bladder habits (i.e incontinence).\n\nMEDS: metoprolol, omeprazole, simvastatin (he is unsure whether this is all)\nALL: nkda\nPMH:\n-HTN; he denies prior dx of DM before yesterday night\n-recurrent cardiogenic syncope, for which he has had &#8220;Reveal&#8221; device implanted, then explanted b\/c of pain, then recurrent sycope and reimplantation of device, after which syncope stopped (see notes in LMR from Dr. Susan Root)\n\nSH: denies t\/e\/d, works as &#8220;Pipefitter&#8221;\nFH: HTN, DM\n\nNeurologic Examination:\nMS: unpleasant, uncooperative w\/ history, angry about being in the ED still\nAOx3, appropriately interactive and conversational.

Neurology was specifically consulted for his gait, which does appear a bit wide-based, but he and wife confirm that this is chronic, and I strongly doubt any relation to his current HA problems. Most obvious medical issues to focus on here are his poorly controlled HTN, which I suspect is the primary cause of his HA, and his uncontrolled DM, of which he obviously does not yet understand the import and does not seem likely to comply with insulin treatment without further education.\n\nIn any case, I find no acute neurological issues.\n\nRecs:\n-BP management\n-DM management.\n\nThanks for this interesting consult.\nCase\/plan discussed w\/ KEKELA neurology attending by phone, Dr. Ivan Guy.\nCall w\/ questions 86383.\n\nKeith Gilbert, MD, PhD,\nNeurology resident PGY3\n\nAddendum:\nHe did not mention this when I questioned him and wife about PMH, but digging through prior LMR notes I find this addition to his PMH:\nA note from Dr. Robert Irish, neurosurgery, from 3\/2099 notes that he is s\/p &#8220;cervical laminectomy and foramen magnum resection followed by removal of an intramedullary tumor near his foramen magnum.

He is a 72-year-old man with CAD S\/P diagnostic cath one week ago at SCMHC, found to have a moderately tight lesion in the LAD without significant disease in the left circumflex or RCA. Because of the recent onset of angina and a stress test showing anterior ischemia, he was brought to ECI, where Dr. Yoseph Flint stented the LAD lesion with a 3.5mm by 32mm Taxus drug-eluting stent, with zero percent residual. The right femoral arteriotomy was closed with an Angioseal, and there were no complications.\n\nHe spent an uneventful evening without complaints, ambulating without difficulty. His left groin was soft without hematoma or bruit, and extremities were warm and well perfused. Morning labs included a BUN of 17, creatinine 0.9, hematocrit 37, platelets 236,000, and flat cardiac enzymes. He was discharged home on Plavix, 75mg po qd for a minimum of six months; enteric-coated aspirin, 325mg po qd; digoxin, 0.25mg po qd; glyburide, 5mg po bid; metoprolol, 50mg po bid; Lipitor, 20mg po qd; Tikosyn, 500mcg po bid; Glucophage, to be resumed at 500mg po bid in two days; and Coumadin, to be resumed tonight.

As you know, Mr. Dejesus is a very pleasant 74-year-old gentleman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who is on Coumadin. He has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia. He has known coronary artery disease and underwent stenting of his left anterior descending artery in 05\/2155, at which time he had a Taxus drug-eluting stent placed. He returns now with increasing dyspnea on exertion and had an elective cardiac catheterization performed at the Southwest Colorado Medical on 07\/13\/2157 that showed focal 90% instent restenosis in the left anterior descending artery with no other focally occlusive disease. He was transferred to the Erie County Infirmary and on the afternoon of 07\/16\/2157, Dr. Yoseph Flint was able to dilate and stent the lesion in the left anterior descending artery with placement of a 3.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent. The procedure was complicated by brief transient no re-flow that resolved immediately to intracoronary nitroglycerin. The left femoral arteriotomy was closed using an Angio-Seal device. Mr. Dejesus has spent an uneventful evening on our Cardiovascular Service. He has had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath. He is ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.\nHis heart rate has been in the 70s, blood pressure in the 110s\/60. He is in atrial fibrillation. His cardiac exam was irregular with no appreciable murmur. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. His left groin is moderately ecchymotic but soft. There is no hematoma or bruit. Extremities are warm and well perfused.\nHis morning labs revealed a sodium of 138, potassium of 4.9, BUN of 21, creatinine of 1.2. His total CK is 58 with a CK-MB of 0.4. His hematocrit is stable at 38, white count of 9, platelets of 300,000. His fasting lipid panel showed a total cholesterol 123 with an HDL of 25, LDL of 49, and triglycerides of 244.\nWe are discharging him home on the following medications: Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, which must be continued for a minimum of the next three months, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily is to be backed off to 81 mg after a few months. He will resume his Coumadin at 5 mg daily, and have this checked with his primary care physician, Dr. Paige. He will be on Lipitor 20 mg p.o. daily, digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. daily, Tikosyn 500 mcg p.o. b.i.d, glyburide 5 mg p.o. daily, Avandia 4 mg p.o. daily, Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily, NPH insulin 16 units each evening and sublingual nitroglycerin to be used as needed for chest pain.

In addition, he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea. In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed, he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA.\n\nHe came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea. On further questioning, he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway. He can walk no further than approximately 50-100 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue. He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent. He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in 03\/19\/2161, but was unsuccessful. Prior to that, cardioversion in February resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved. He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left-sided chest discomfort. Cardiac catheterization on 01\/18\/2161 revealed a 30% LAD in-stent restenosis, 90% septal lesion, and 65% -70% PDA lesion that was stented. A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 35-40%.\n\nOther than significant exertional shortness of breath, he feels relatively well. He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope. He denies any PND, orthopnea, or lower extremity swelling. He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations. His weight has been stable.\n\nOn review of systems, he denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats. His weight has remained stable. He denies any new onset cough, wheezing, or hemoptysis.\n\nPast Medical History:\n1. CAD status post LAD PCI\/stenting in 2155. He developed in-stent restenosis in 07\/2157, during which time he received a second drug-eluting stent to the LAD lesion. He developed recurrent chest discomfort in 12\/2159, and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an 80% mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a 30% proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis. He underwent a drug-eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion. A followup catheterization in 01\/2161 revealed a 30% LAD stenosis, 90% large septal branch lesion, and a 65-70% proximal PDA stenosis. Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 35-40%. He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on 03\/06\/2161. An exercise Myoview performed in 01\/2160 revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia.\n2. Hypertension.\n3. Dyslipidemia.\n4. Diabetes.\n5. Obstructive sleep apnea.\n6. COPD, prescribed home oxygen, though he is not taking this.\n7. Carotid disease, status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax.\n8? History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in 07\/2159.\n9. Atrial fibrillation.\n10. Obesity.\n\nHe has no known drug allergies.\n\nHis current medications include amiodarone 200 mg BLANK, but this has been discontinued since April, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d, digoxin 0.25 mg daily, Zocor 20 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, TriCor 145 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, BLANK 5 mg nightly, aspirin 325 mg daily, Lantus insulin 62 units daily, Humalog insulin, and Protonix 40 mg daily.\n\nHis social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence. He was formally employed in buidling construction. He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection. He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol.\n\nHis family history is negative for early onset CAD, sudden cardiac death, or cardiomyopathy. His father lived until the age of 88. His mother died of a stroke at the age of 80. He has a single sister who is 86 years of age and has no history of heart troubles.\n\nPhysical Examination: His blood pressure is 115\/60 BLANK of 66 beats per minute. In general, he is overweight elderly man in no distress. Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles. Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally. Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases, but otherwise clear. There is no wheezing. Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S1 and S2. There is no audible murmur, rub or gallop. Abdomen is obese, soft, and nontender. Lower extremities are warm and well perfused. There is trace pitting edema at the ankles.\n\nRecent blood work reveals an INR of 2.2 on 05\/28\/2161.\n\nEKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute. There are some nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes. There is some low voltage in the limb leads, though I suspect this is related to his habitus.\n\nOverall, Mr. Dejesus is a pleasant 78-year-old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath. He appears to be functional class III. He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today, though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal. Moreover, he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease.\n\nWe discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today. We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation. However, given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3-4 month post-ablation may be required to adjudicate success. Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities, we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation. We will leave this decision to them. Moreover, prior to the ablation, we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation.\n\nThank you very much for referring Mr. Dejesus to our care. We will be in touch following the procedure. As always, feel free to call with any questions.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nOscar U Rice, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-16320445 HFFocus\n\nCC: Robert-Joseph Paige M.D.\nKoenen Collins County Clinic\n266 Paxton Terrace\nPeculiar, NE, 54583\nFax:\nEmail:\n\n\n\nDD: 06\/03\/61\nDT: 06\/04\/61\nDV: 06\/03\/61\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2086-10-19\n10-19-86 This patient was seen with Dr. Nabor Jacoby. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 29 year old woman with diabetes and obesity. Her problems are as follows: 1. Diabetes. She was sent to me from OB\/GYN because of her high glucose and she was put on insulin by me. Xitlali Xia followed her in order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls. She finally comes back and I am relieved, but she has not brought any list of her blood sugars. She says she does take them about twice a day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and threw them away. She says that they never go higher than 200; that they usually are about 110. It was 101 this morning before breakfast, she says. She says it does get as low as 19 and five or six times it has been below 50. She does say she eats three regular meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten breakfast she said no. She is seeing a nutritionist this morning. I will check a hemoglobin A1C today. I expressed to her again how important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets. She had been eating a lot of chocolate. She says she has gotten off of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it then. She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will help her with her diet. If her diet does get better, maybe we can wean her off the insulin and try Micronase. I explained to her, too, that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might be able to get her off the insulin. This seemed to be something that she would like to do. Hopefully the nutritionist can help. I also told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was really going on and whether they are getting too low. She denies any kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19. I am wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly. She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no nothing. She felt totally normal. So hopefully she will really record these and we will get a better idea. She said this always happens in the morning. She kept contradicting herself and had no documentation. I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick. She does drink juice, but I went over the symptoms again with her. She will call me if she does have any. 10-19-86 2. Left ankle pain. I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested. She said that she may do some surgery on her. 3. Dysuria. She says this is totally resolved after giving her the Bactrim. 4. Yeast infection. She said this has also resolved. 5. She complains of headache. She says these have been going on for two or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some. She has had nausea and vomited once. This happened pretty much every day and it can be at any time of the day. Tylenol and Advil did not help. She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there. But she has no further prodrome. She says it is a banging kind of pain that is rhythmic. She also says she does see stars in front of her eyes when it happens. I asked her if she had any hearing loss, and she said that she hears voices but people are not there sometimes. It has been happening for a couple of weeks. I discussed this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like migraines. I will not image her head now as there is no evidence that this would be something to do with brain tumor. Her neuro exam was totally normal. Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact. Her gait was normal. Light touch was touched. Her toes were downgoing. Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally. Her disks were sharp. EOMI, PERRL. I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO t.i.d. and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind her left ear. I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this. 6. Health maintenance. I thought that since she is diabetic and obese that she might benefit from a flu shot. She has no interest in this at all. Her blood pressure was 110\/70 in the left arm with a thigh cuff. Her pulse was 96. Her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was 285. Xitlali Crane, M.D. CCL:FG:1879 DD:10-19-86 DT:10-21-86 DV:10-19-86 * Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider *\n\n* Record date: 2087-10-19\nLOVELAND INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES Youngman, Cody 06386371 10-19-87 HPI: Ms. Youngman is a 30-year-old woman with diabetes who comes in for a regular follow-up. Assessment and Plan: 1. Diabetes. She said she has been doing well, sticking to her diet, has had no hypoglycemic episodes, and that her fingersticks have been ranging between 120 and 160, never above and never below. This is borne out by her last hemoglobin A1C on 6-04-87 which was 4.9. She definitely does have good control, and she is working hard as her weight is down to 236 lb from 238.75 on 6-29-87. She had a recent hemoglobin A1C and urine dip. She, however, is due for an eye exam as she has no had one for over a year and is willing to go, so I referred her. She also needs to see a Podiatrist as she has not seen one; she will go. 2. Health maintenance. Patient does not want a flu shot. Otherwise, she is up to date except for a Pap smear, but she had her daughter with her so asked if she could have her Pap smear on her next visit. We will do so. 3. Migraine headaches. She said she has had one every day recently. This is worse than her usual. The Motrin was not helping. I therefore prescribed Midrin and explained to her expressly how to use. Should this not help, she will page me as she knows how to do. I will see her back soon to make sure this is getting better. 4. Ankle pain. Patient has chronic ankle pain. She went to an Orthopedist who told her a while back to lose weight and see if it got better. She has been slowly losing weight with no improvement and would like to go back to the Orthopedist. I therefore referred her at her request. Xitlali Crane, M.D. FS:XI:4842 DD:10-19-87 DT:10-20-87 DV:10-19-87 * Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider *\n\n* Record date: 2088-09-14\nLOVELAND INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES Youngman, Cody 06386371 9-14-88 HPI: Ms. Youngman is a 31 year old woman with a history of morbid obesity, complicated by diabetes, who was a former patient of Dr. Xitlali Crane. She comes in today for routine follow-up. Patient's diabetes was initially diagnosed during gestation with her daughter. Patient was formerly controlled by insulin but has lost 61 pounds over the last 16 months and is now off all medications and states her finger sticks have been excellent with a peak of about 150, with most well below that. Patient also has a history of in situ which was treated with laser treatment to the cervix. She is a hemophiliac carrier. Has a history of migraines and currently is being treated by Dr. Jacoby for depression. Since her last visit with Dr. Crane, patient apparently attempted suicide in July. It is unclear how serious the attempt was although she did cut her left upper extremity. Since then she states that she has been feeling a lot better and feels that she has really made progress with Dr. Jacoby. Her mood seems fine today in clinic. Patient denies any medical symptoms at this time. Patient's cardiac risk factors include smoking 5-6 cigarettes a day. A positive family history of coronary artery disease including a mother who just died of a heart attack in May at age 53 and had had a previous MI at age 40 and a CABG at age 43. Patient does not have hypercholesterolemia or hypertension but does have the diabetes history as noted above. SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for tobacco use as noted above and she drinks about one beer per day when she is distraught that she continues to do. She says that she should not be drinking with her medications. PHYSICAL EXAM: Moderately obese Hispanic woman in no acute distress. Blood pressure: 120\/70. HEENT: unremarkable. Neck: no JVD, carotids were 2+ bilaterally without bruits. Chest: clear. Cardiac: within normal limits. Abdomen: benign. Extremities: without edema. ASSESSMENT\/PLAN: 1. Weight control: Patient has had excellent weight loss over the last 16 months. I told her how impressed I was with this. She, in fact, does not require any oral hypoglycemics for good sugar control at this time. I will let her continue this dietary control for the next six months and check her hemoglobin A1C at that time to assess her control. However, in the past, she has been very straight forward with Dr. Crane according to her notes. 2. Depression: Patient continues to be actively depressed. Is currently on trazodone, Klonopin, Paxil and Motrin. She will continue to follow-up with Dr. Jacoby with whom she seems to be very happy. LOVELAND INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES Youngman, Cody Page 2 06386371 9-14-88 3. General health care: Patient will need a pelvic exam in six months time. Patient currently has an intrauterine device which was placed in June. She does not take oral contraceptives because of her history of diabetes and history of heart disease. She was instructed that she should go to Gynecological Clinic if any symptoms related to the IUD occur. 4. Diabetes: Patient's blood sugars have had peaks of about 150 as mentioned above. I will check her hemoglobin A1C in six months time. Patient feels good with no polydipsia, no urinary frequency and no headache. I elected, therefore, not to treat it at this time. Patient was given prescriptions for fingersticks and lancets.

Type II diabetes mellitus. 2. CAD. 3. History of CIN2 status post laser treatment to the cervix. 4. Depression. 5. History of substance abuse. 6. GERD.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 325mg PO q.d, atenolol 25mg PO q.d, glyburide 5mg PO q.d, Lipitor 10mg PO q.h.s, Celexa 20mg PO q.d, Zantac 150mg PO q.h.s, Prevacid 30mg PO q.d, trazodone 150mg PO q.h.s.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today to follow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and depression. Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care complaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a day in addition to maintenance with q.h.s. Zantac and scheduled for a upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a pro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI study. She is scheduled later this month. She has no new complaints, although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled it over the past two days. She denies any increasing polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia. Says until yesterday, she had been taking all of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in the morning. I pressed her about this because she has a history of being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain that she has been taking them. It is not entirely clear to me whether this is true or not.\nRegarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation. She says she is feeling a little bit better. She was recently started on risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once a month. She is also seeing a counselor there weekly. She says overall she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana. We again discussed the importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.\nRegarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or frequency. She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at rest.\nLOVELAND MEMEORIAL HOSPITAL LOVELAND Internal Medicine Associates 57 Colgate Road Youngman, Cody Cincinnati, WA 33699 06386371 11-30-93 Page 2\nPHYSICAL EXAM: She is a morbidly obese woman in no acute distress. Her pulse is 80 and regular, blood pressure 134\/74. Her weight today is 249lb. Her sclera are nonicteric. Her JVP is not visible at 90 degrees. There are no carotid bruits. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and her cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm, positive S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Her extremities are warm and without significant edema. Her finger stick blood sugar in the office today was 331.\nASSESSMENT\/PLAN: Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.\n1. Diabetes. Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, essentially unchanged from six months prior. Finger stick in the office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly over the past couple of months. In any event, she most likely need a higher dose of sulphonurea. We will check a hemoglobin A1C today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan. Her last urine microalbumin was negative.\n2. Hypercholesterolemia. When she returns to clinic in three months, we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on Lipitor for approximately six months.\n3. Coronary disease. She is still having exertional chest pain. Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d. as she did have room to go with her pulse and blood pressure.\n4. Depression. I again encouraged her to continue following up with her psychiatrist and her counselor. Again, reinforced the importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA again as I have in the past.\n5. GERD. She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her PPI and H2 blocker for now. I told her she should take the Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.\n6. Health maintenance. She received a flu shot and she will return to clinic in three months to follow up on her diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease. Additionally, I referred her to Nutrition for further counseling regarding weight loss and a heart-healthy diabetic diet. I also stressed the LOVELAND MEMEORIAL HOSPITAL LOVELAND Internal Medicine Associates 06 Colgate Road Youngman, Cody Cincinnati, WA 33699 06386371 11-30-93 Page 3\nimportance of her seeing the eye doctor.

Since I last saw her, she\nhas been hospitalized with bilateral pyelonephritis in mid\nOctober. Since discharge, she has been feeling well, and a\nrepeat urinalysis and urine culture on October 27, 2094, were\nessentially within normal limits. She denies any recurrent flank\npain, fevers, chills, or dysuria. Says overall she is feeling\nrelatively well. She is taking all of her medications as\nprescribed. She denies any polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia,\nfatigue, or blurry vision. She continues to smoke. She has not\nbeen exercising. She also continues to have intermittent chest\npain of unclear etiology. Several days ago, she had an episode\nthat lasted a minute or two at rest. She described it as a\ntightness, and it was not associated with shortness of breath,\nnausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or neck or arm symptoms. She has\nno recurrent symptoms since then, and has had no exertional\nsymptoms in the past few days. She has not been taking her blood\nsugars at home as her machine is broken. Also, she self-\ndiscontinued her lisinopril. She thought it gave her a headache.\n\n\n\nYoungman, Codi\n06386371\n11\/24\/94\nPage 2\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is an obese young woman in no\ndistress. Pulse 68 and regular. Blood pressure 134\/84 and\nweight 226. Fingerstick today 198. Neck veins are non-elevated.\nNo carotid bruits. Oropharynx is clear. Lungs are clear to\nauscultation bilaterally. Cardiac exam is regular rhythm.\nNormal S1 and S2. No murmurs. Extremities are warm and without\nedema. Feet are without ulcerations and sensation is intact to\nvibration and light touch.\n\nLABORATORY DATA: Her EKG today reveals a normal sinus rhythm,\nnormal axis, normal intervals, normal ST segments, and normal T-\nwaves. Hematocrit and troponin are pending.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 37-year-old woman with multiple medical\nproblems as follows:\n1. Type 2 diabetes. Her hemoglobin A1c has continued to run in\nthe 9.0. She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to\ntry Glucophage again due to the diarrhea. At this point, it\nis prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin\nregimen starting with b.i.d. NPH, and we will refer her to the\ndiabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month\nwith a plan to transition her at that time. Her urine\nmicroalbumin was negative a few months ago. We will recheck\nher hemoglobin A1c today. She has been to the ophthalmologist\nrecently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.\n2. Regarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest\npain is somewhat concerning. She does have coronary disease\nas per her MIBI just over a year ago. She is taking an\naspirin and a beta-blocker. Her EKG today is normal, and she\nhas been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with\nexertion. Given this, I advised her should she have recurrent\npain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to\nthe emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin\nand beta-blocker. I will repeat her stress test to see if her\nischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider\nreferring her to Cardiology.\n\n\n\nYoungman, Codi\n06386371\n11\/24\/94\nPage 3\n\n\n3. Regarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would\nprefer better blood pressure control. She agreed to try the\nlisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she\nthinks it disagrees with her. I told her I felt the headache\nwas probably unrelated to the lisinopril.\n4. Regarding health maintenance, when I see her back in a month,\nI will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left\ntoday without receiving one.\n5. I will see her back in clinic in one month.\n\n\n\n\nJeffrey Koehler, M.D.\n\nJK\/JW4\n502491.do\nc\nDD:\n11\/24\/2094\nDT:\n11\/25\/2094\nDV:\n11\/24\/2094\n\n\n\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\n\n===========================Preceptor Notes====================================\n\n\nDr. Koehler and I jointly interviewed and examined this 37 year old patient who presents for f\/u of diabetes, depression, pyelonephritis.

Mr. Aguilar is a 48 yo man with h\/o CF with mild pulmonary disease, who presented to an OSH on 1\/26 with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias, followed by a loss of left visual field, diplopia, and left sided weakness. The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness. The patient was evaluated at the OSH with non-contrast head CT and L\/P which were significant only for elevated CSF protein. Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms, as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam. Exam also notable for disdiadochokinesis, otherwise neurologic exam non-focal. Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles. DDX for above includes ischemic process, though symptoms appear to be multi-focal, vs. mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process. Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms, or meningeal process. We plan to obtain CNS MRI, neuro consult. Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic work-up. Continue maintenance medications for CF.\n\n\nDebra F. Mullen, MD\n\n\n* Record date: 2082-09-29\nI have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and reviewed and edited the note and I agree with the assessment and plan developed under my personal supervision as documented by previosu PA note from Ursula Bowers, PA-C. Please see additional comments below.\nVicente Aguilar is a 49 y\/o male with cystic fibrosis, moderate to severe lung disease, colonized with mucoid-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa pancreatic insufficiency, CF related DM, HTN, renal insufficiency with proteinuria, recent h\/o CVA, gout, cataracts who is currently experiencing a subacute exacerbation of his pulmonary disease requiring hospitalization to initiate IV antibiotics. His symptoms include long-standing fatigue, increased cough and sputum production, some SOB with mild chest tightness and wheezing. His FEV1 significantly decreased during recent clicni visit. He also reports some sinus headaches, but denies sinus pain or tenderness. He denies hemoptysis, fever\/chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. Please see details regarding recent MRI\/MRA results on PA note above, as well as medications, and other pertinent historical data reviewed independently.\nVSS: afebrile, oxygen saturation Gen: alert, NAD HEENT: sclera clear, persistent visual defects right upper quadrant visual field, neck supple CV: regular Lungs: essentially clear with good aeration, no wheezes wuth few scattered ronchi. Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, no masses Ext: warm, clubbing Neuro: normal gait, oriented x 3.\nAssessment\/Plan: Vicente Aguilar is a 49 y\/o male with cystic fibrosism noderate to severe lung disease with past medical history as noted above who is currently experiencing a subacute exacerbation of his pulmonary disease requiring hospitalization to initiate IV antibiotics\n1. PULM\/ID: We will start treatment with tobramycin 700 mg IV q am, as well as Ceftazidime 2 g IV q 8 hours based on culture results. We will continue maintenance pulmonary medications including bronchodilators, mucolytics and steroids. We will discuss hypertonic saline therapy and trial its use if agreeable. We will send a new sputum sample for culture. Chest x-ray after PICC placement. Will review routine admission labs.\n2. CVS: monitor blood pressure assess need for other protective medications. Will continue antihypertensives, ACEi and ARB if creatinine stable. We will review findings from recent MRI\/MRA. Check lipid profile if not done, on Zocor.\n3. FEN\/GI: High calorie, high protein CF diet.\n4. Renal: check electrolytes, as well as UA with random protein and creatinine. His creatinine was elevated to 1.6, now 1.5 and was 1.1-1.4 at baseline. He described an incident last week with nausea and vomiting that likely led to above result while taking colchicine, celebrex, and other meds. This is probabyl on its way to improvement. We did not hold ACEi and ARB at this time, but will repeat Cr tonight. He will drink fluids during the day priro to PICC by IR. He does not have a nephrologist adn will need to find him one. He did have a renal biopsy in teh late 60s adn thus will look for results, but renal disease likely multigfactorial. We will tobra levels bvery close adn started at low dose for his size. Will likely check renal US while here.\n5. Endo: continue insulin regimen. He will check blood sugars more frequently and folow HgA1c. He did state that he occasionally gets blood sugars in the 40s when he wakes up, but usually nto when he is sedentary, ie. admitted to hospital. IF BS normal here, he will check them very closely at home as well and make adjustments as necesary. We will also need toset him up with Endocrinologist.\n6. Access: PICC line to be placed in IR\n7. Dispo: 14 day of inpatient IV antibiotics\n8. Neuro: He was last seen by Neurologist on 8\/30 and was discharged from routine follow-up. He will continue anti-hypertensive meds and ASA. He contineu sot have visual deficit in R upper quadrant.\n\nQuinton Israel,D.O.\n\n* Record date: 2084-12-07\nPulmonary Service Admission Note Vicente Aguilar #98179909 December 7, 2084\nHPI 51 y\/o male with cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficency and CRI who was last admitted for cleanout in 1\/2084 now presenting after being seen by Dr Mann as outpatient on long island with newly increased creatinine above baseline and to initiate cleanout. He notes he has been doing fairly well this last year. He was seen for a physical by his primary care physician Dr Haas on November 13th at which time he reports she told him he was doing well. Dr Mann followed up with her on his lab studies and results and called Mr Aguilar on friday alerting him to the change in his renal function. It was decided that he be admitted for renal work-up as well as initiating cleanout as he does his cleanouts yearly. He notes he has felt generally well with no increased cough or sputum, chest pain or tightness. He notes he has 'danced around' some cold symptoms earlier in the summer but has had none since. He denies any fevers or chills and notes he only gets sweats if he has a low blood sugar. He denies any N\/V, diarrhea or constipation and has stable appetite. He notes stable weight of 185-186 lbs. He notes he has had erratic control of his blood sugar as he does at times 'forget' to give himself insulin. He does monitoe his BS four times per day. He denies any dysuria, hematuria or urgency. he does note frequency has increased over the year, he now urinates every few hours. He denies any sore throat or sinus pain, does have occasional mild congestion.\nReviwe of systems: he has a flu shot, denies sick contacts. notes his prostate exam at his PCP office was reported to be normal. denies reflux symptoms, does have feeling of pills sticking' when he swallows them occasionally.\nPMH: Cystic Fibrosis Pancreatic insufficiency CF related Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Nephrotic syndrome (baseline creatinine 1.1), chart dx at CHB of GN, unclear source of dx Gout Cataracts\nAllergies: NKDA\nMedications: Aspirin 81 mg po daily Colchicine 0.6 mg po daily Probenecid 250 mg po bid Azithromycin 500 mg po q thu\/sat\/Monday simvastatin 20 mg po qhs Cozaar 50 mg po BID Accolate 20 mg po bid Albuterol inh prn Plaretase 8000 6 tabs po qac\/ snacks (what his pharmacy switched him to as pancrecarb not available) Protonix 40 mg po daily Lantus 12 u qhs Humalog scale ac\nFH\/SH: lives on long island with partner of 4 years, she is a Notary.

Her spouse is present.\nPatient says she is status post a fall this past Monday at home. Says that she seems to have lost her balance while opening a door at home. Denies prodromal symptoms including shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. There was no loss of consciousness. Patient was seen in the emergency room that day for trauma to the head. Had a negative CT of her head and had an x-ray of her pelvis, as she complained of some hip pain. Both studies were negative. Patient was then sent home with Roxicet. Patient was seen in the walk-in clinic at CPI yesterday, after noticing a swollen tongue and some difficulty swallowing. Patient was immediately told to stop both her Roxicet and Monopril and was treated for angioedema with Zantac and Claritin. Today patient has no further throat tightness or tongue swelling. She is, however, uncomfortable continuing the Effexor for unclear reasons and wants to stop it.\nPatient is also complaining of severe low back pain, which she says has persisted since her fall on Monday. Did not have an x-ray of the area. Says it is very painful to sit. Roxicet was not helping. She is off her Ultram as well.\nPHYSICAL EXAM: WD\/overweight female in NAD. Vital signs as per LMR, WNL. Weight 213 pounds.\nLungs - clear bilateral breath sounds. Cor - RRR, S1, S2, without murmur or S3 noted. Back - slightly bent gait. Tenderness over lower sacrum. No asymmetry or obvious deformity.\nX-ray of sacrum 12\/13\/63 - could not see fracture as per my reading.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n(1) Angioedema. Agree that most likely culprits are Roxicet since it was started only two days ago, and ACE inhibitors which have been associated with angioedema. Currently on Lopressor and Dyazide, patient's blood pressure is WNL. So will follow for now.\n(2) Low back pain. Reviewed the possibility of a coccygeal fracture for which treatment would not be any different than pain management and a donut pillow. Patient was given a prescription for the pillow. She was told to look out for signs of nerve compression and to go to the ER if she experienced any perianal numbness or incontinence. Will notify patient by phone if x-ray shows a fracture.\n(3) Depression. Did not feel I was able to speak freely in front of the patient's spouse. Had been put on the Effexor by Dr. Zeman. Advised patient to let her psychiatrist know that we are tapering her off of the Effexor. Will take 25 mg q.o.d. for the next week.\n(4) Pain control.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 66 year old, right-handed female whose past medical history is significant for status post laminectomy at L3 to L5 in January of 2061. The patient was in her usual state of health with some residual weakness from the stenosis and occasional buckling of her knees without loss of consciousness until 12\/01 when she fell backwards. There was no obvious leg buckling. She said she just came off balance without loss of consciousness or dizziness or preceding lightheadedness. Since then she has had several falls always when she is moving. MEDICATIONS: Her medications have included in the past Motrin 800 t.i.d. without significant effect on her low back pain. Ultram q.i.d. was beneficial. Neurontin 300 q.i.d. which was also beneficial without side effect and chondroitin sulfate which she feels has been very helpful without side effect. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She has bilateral dysesthesias, left sciatica to her ankle. She has had weight loss without fevers, chills or night sweat. She has had no retinopathy and she has a history of reflux and otherwise her cardiovascular, pulmonary, GI\/GU and musculoskeletal review of systems are unremarkable. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Spinal stenosis with a laminectomy at L3, 4 and 5 in January of 2061. She has had left knee arthroscopy. She had mild spinal stenosis at T12 to L1, severe at L3\/4 and 4\/5 with bilateral foraminal disease. She has had a ten year history of diabetes. She has hypertension and hypothyroidism. MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Premarin, glynase, glucophage, metoprolol and Effexor. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married. No history of tobacco or alcohol. FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease, breast cancer and diabetes. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a well-appearing, well-nourished, 66 year old female. Her mental state examination is normal. Cranial nerves II through XII are intact. Motor strength is significant for full strength in the upper extremities as well as the lower extremities. Sensation is intact to all modalities with bilateral lower extremity dysesthesia reported subjectively. DTR's are symmetric with downgoing toes bilaterally. Coordination is intact with no axial or appendicular ataxia. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 66 year old right-handed female with history of spinal stenosis status post decompression who has a history of falls. We will obtain an MRI of her lumbosacral to evaluate that area for any recurrent pathology or new changes. For her radicular pain will increase her Neurontin 400 q.i.d. We would like to obtain EMG with nerve conduction studies of the lower extremities to evaluate possible need for reoperation. The patient will return to clinic after these studies. The patient was seen and evaluated and management was discussed with the attending.

Ms. Umphrey is somewhat cognitively and expressively impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm 1\/ 66; she was required sub-occipital craniotomy, clot evacuation, and placement for a VP shunt. She was transferred to Kingsley County Clinic 2\/66, and was d\/c'd 5\/31\/66. Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow 1 step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication. She gets nutrition and medication through a G-tube at this point, and has had an indwelling foley catheter.\nComputer notes suggest that prior to August 5, the indwelling foley catheter had been removed. However, the patient's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry, the notes suggest that the foley was replaced 8\/5\/66. 8\/09\/66 Ms. Umphrey was taken to the emergency room; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear. U\/A was suggestive of a UTI, and she was treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin. There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time, and urine cultures were not sent. Telephone notes from 8\/23 suggest that Ms. Umphrey had yeast infection and foley blockage; 8\/25 the VNA checked a U\/A at home; results were consistent with a UTI. Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and less herself over the last few days. She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation.\nIn the ED, repeat U\/A was consistent with UTI; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus. She was given a dose of levofloxacin 500mg and transferred to the floor.\n\nPMH: (Per chart- pt unable to provide history)\n1.

Patient says he was diagnosed as having neuropsychiatric lupus in 2103 at the Vermilion Hospital by Dr. Parker Xian and was treated with steroids at the time. It's not clear what CNS or neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time. Because of complex partial seizures he was seen by Dr. Arce at the Livingstone Homes who referred him to Dr. Hoffman at the Livingstone Homes who said that his estradiol level was in the 80s. His testosterone was up but available testosterone was down so he was put on Clomid and testolactone which he said turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures. Said he was doing fine until around 2 weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred. He said his neck felt full and warm. His head felt like it was going to explode. He had tinnitus, excess saliva, he felt that his lower jaw was vibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasn't right. Also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and postnasal drip. Lab work on February 8 showed a normal CBC, urine, and anti-DNA (in 2103 his ANA was positive at 1:1024 but I don't have any other results). He's had no fevers, no rashes other than a folliculitis on his legs. No new problem with head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, teeth or gum except that he has to wear his glasses. Recently had some teeth removed. Has a postnasal drip with a little bit of a cough. No other cardiorespiratory problems but takes Altace for mild hypertension. No GI problems. Has urinary frequency due to nocturia ever 2 hours, due to benign prostatic hypertrophy and recently had a TUR. Dr. Nunes RE: Craft, Lloyd MRN: 26649180 February 17, 2114 Page 2 A PSA has been normal. Past history of kidney stones. He's allergic to penicillin, Lozol, allopurinol and bee venom. Has a past history of diagnosis of gout versus pseudogout. Sleeps fine. No history of fractures. Only operation is a total knee replacement on the left for arthritis and appendectomy. Bruises easily, frequently has headaches. Has been diagnosed as being bipolar. Exercises. Recent MRI consistent with a vasculopathy. Family history. Mother died of colon cancer at 62, smoked. Father died at 62 of heart attack, stroke and insulin dependent diabetes, also smoked. He is an only child. Social history. Doesn't smoke. When he's depressed he becomes a binge drinker. Exercises when he's not depressed. He's retired since 2103. Was a stage manager. Physical exam. Somewhat overweight gentleman. Blood pressure was 160\/80. Pulse was 88 and regular. Skin, a hint of livedo reticularis on forearms, and a couple of infected hair follicles around his knees. One small node in the left side of his neck. Mouth and throat was clear. Bilateral nasal polyp more on the right than left. Ear drums fine. Hearing fine (tuning fork in the middle of the forehead was heard in the forehead). Chest clear. No CVA tenderness. Heart: No murmurs. Abdomen, no organs, masses, tenderness but obese. Extremity, joint exam fine. Neurological fine. I do not think that his lupus has acted up but think most of his current symptoms could be explained by an upper respiratory tract infection. However, I suspect he might have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and therefore have tested him for that, and also for complement level to also exclude lupus and vasculitis. Basically I told him to take Flonase twice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip cleared up. In the meantime continue on the Lamictal 100 mg twice a day as a stabilizer, Risperdal 0.25 mg per day as a mood stabilizer, the testolactone 50 mg 4 times a day to increase the availability of testosterone, the Clomid (clomiphene citrate) 50 mg per day to decrease estradiol, Levoxyl 50 mcg twice a day, Altace 10 mg twice a day regarding hypertension, and ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day for low back pain. Patient also gave me 2 pages of notes similar to what he had including comments regarding increased appetite, decreased memory, Dr. Nunes RE: Craft, Lloyd MRN: 26649180 February 17, 2114 Page 3 decreased cognitive function, decreased balance, fatigue, decreased hearing, a history of carotid sinus, hypersensitivity, question of cholinergic transmission problems. Also should be noted that a lot of his symptoms coincided with taking Aricept to improve his memory. Took it for 10 days and hasn't taken it for 2 weeks but his symptoms persisted. Thank you again for asking me to see him. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Sincerely yours, Richard Aviles, M.D. PS: If you could give me some information of what evidence there was that he had systemic lupus and neuropsychiatric lupus back in 2103 at the Vermilion Hospital, for instance the discharge summary from the Vermilion Hospital, that would be appreciated.

As you know, he is a 64 year old, right-handed man with an extensive past medical history for a rheumatological disease. His past medical history, briefly, is that he was diagnosed with lupus in 2103 and at that time he had a butterfly rash, he complained of chronic fatigue and he also had what was considered temporal lobe seizures which were characterized as complex partial type events, and elevated double- stranded DNA of 1:80 and ANA of 1:512 with a homogenous pattern. All of these suggested that the patient did have lupus. He was treated for approximately three years with prednisone and he notes that after medications were added by Dr. Taliyah Hoffman, his symptoms and seizures went away. Since that time, he has had a recurrence of symptoms which includes fullness of his face and neck, pressure within his head. He considers himself to have vascular headaches with facial weakness, ringing in his ears, numbness and tingling of his left hand and arm, excessive salivation and increased appetite. In describing his headache, he noted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and has a combination of throbbing sensation as well as throbbing quality. It is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not associated with nausea, vomiting or paraesthesias. There is no family history of migraines as well. Also during his headache events, he does not notice any decrease in his appetite or any nausea or vomiting. Past medical history: As per above. Medicval issues include bipolar II with diagnosed in 2110, hypothalamic gonadism, hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of migraine headaches. His current medications include Lamictal, Risperdal, testolactone, chromisene, Levoxyl, Altace for hypertension, ibuprofen p.r.n. and prednisone p.r.n. He is allergic to penicillin, Lozol, bee stings and allopurinol. There is a questionable history to Aricept which he feels that the use of this medication made his current symptoms come out of remission. Brice Short, M.D. RE:Craft, Lloyd MRN:26649180 3-16-14 Page 2 Family history is remarkable for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in father and father also had heart disease. Social history: He is a former stage manager. Neurological exam: He was awake, alert, oriented x 3. Attention was normal. Speech was fluent, without dysarthria or paraphasic errors. There is no memory deficit or agnosia. The patient gave a very detailed history of events and no further detailed mental status testing was performed. Cranial nerves: Bilateral visual fields were full. Disks were sharp. Fundus was clear. Extraocular movements were intact. There was no nystagmus. He had normal facial sensation and symmetry. Hearing was grossly normal. Uvula, tongue and palate were midline. Motor examination revealed normal tone and bulk with normal strength. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical. There was no upper motor neuron sign. Coordination and gait were normal. Overall impression: 64 year old, right-handed male with a history of lupus in the past. His recent blood work shows that his double-stranded DNA was negative. Taking into consideration his current constellation of symptoms and his MRI reports that I evaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular disease, at this time he does not fit with the diagnosis of central nervous system vasculitis. He was told that he is at a high risk for having a stroke secondary to (1) having high blood pressure and (2) having an elevated cholesterol. If it is possible to maintain his blood pressure in good control and start a cholesterol-lowering agent, he is to discuss this with you, and also consider starting aspirin 81mg PO q.d. for primary prevention of heart disease. He was informed that it is possible that there is some element of his immune system fluctuations and possibly his hormonal therapies may be contributing to some of his symptomatology but the diagnosis or etiology of these symptoms is not clear. Thank you for letting me take part in your patient's healthcare. Sincerely, Clarence K.

No photo- or phono-phobia, no nuchal rigidity.\nLabs\/Studies: of note BUN 21, Cr 1.2, MCV 95, Hct 41.6, wbc 13.3\nNeuroimaging: Personally reviewed HCT - mildly large vents, no s\/o SDH or SAH or infarct\/mass lx\/hemorrhage.\nAssessment:: Likely Communicating Hydrocephalus with mild elevation of ICP in context of minor head trauma. On exam shows psychomotor retardation, d\/w concentration, retrieval (including memory and words), frontal fucntions including set-switching on Lurias, and working memory. He also has moderate retropulsion on exam worse on pull-test than spontaneously, and hypomimia. His vents are mildly dilated in context of general cerebral atrophy that is not o\/w out-of-proportion for his advanced age. Onset of his sx's including bilateral headache described as constant 6-8\/10 pressure at posterior vertex w\/ occ. radiation foward made worse by lying down for some time (worse in the mornings) and better in the afternoons or after sitting or standing. No blurred vision but mild nausea w\/o vomiting. No nuchal rigidity or photo-phonophobia. No f\/c\/ns\/cp\/sob\/rash\/weakness\/changes in sensation. Describes very clear psychomotor retardation since first fall including d\/w concentraion, memory and word retrieval, and extreme slowness in mental processing (including reading - used to be a speed reader and now reads one word at a time very slowly). He's had some urinary urgency but no incontinencey. Describes his d\/w gait as not being able to get his legs to do what he wants them to do despite having good strength. Additionally, feels that he's always losing his balance backwards. No suggestion of meningoencephalitis, stroke or seizure. Had mild bilat tinnitus but no vertigo. Does ascribe rare very transient visual distortion and object movement (up\/down). WBC mildly elevated but no fever and U\/A and CXR are negative.\nOverall, there is a diad of gait apraxia and frontal cognitive dysfunction and psychomotor retardation (no urinary incontinence) in context of sx's of mildly elevated ICP and mildly enlarged vents. Has a mild small and large fiber distal symmetric polyneuropathy which exacerbates his gait difficulties. He is also at least mildly anxious and moderately anxious. Had bradycardia in ED - now better but need to follow.\nPlan:\n- Optimize pain\/headache control - Neuro checks q4hrs - Cardiac telemetry - Elevated ICP (mild) precautions with HOB > 45 degrees; and gentle hydration (he is dehydrated by labs) - MRI of brain to better assess vents and possible transependymal flow, as well as to exclude much less likely brainstem and posterior fossa lesions. Also need to assess posterior circulation w\/ MRA (had mild constant tinnutus), and assess for small SDH (b\/o h\/o head trauma). - check B12, homocysteine, TSH, ESR, hsCRP, ANA\n- After Brain MRI is reviewed, need to assess fundi, gait and cognition (formally score and time) and then perform diagnostic LP for hydrocephalus -- measuring opening and closing pressure after removing ~ 20cc and sending for cell count, glucose, TP, and xanthochromia as well as keeping ~ 10 cc.\n- Hold sotalol, complete cardiac\/MI r\/o by enzymes. - Follow wbc and monitor for s\/s infection.\nDiscussed assessment and plan with pt and family who understand and agree.\n\n\nTom Tejeda, M.D, Ph.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2079-03-23\n\n\nMarch 23, 2079\n\n\n\n\nGage Yingling, M.D.\nProtestant Home Hospital\n57 Chinook Drive\nWhiteville, AL 73844\n\n\nRE: Adler, Imogene\nMRN: 618-13-82-6\n\n\nDear Dr. Yingling:\n\nThank you for referring your patient, Imogene Adler,\nfor her problem of coronary ischemia. As you know, Ms.\nAdler is a 49 year old woman with four years of\nessential hypertension and mild dyslipidemia who is\npostmenopausal and has noticed increasing symptoms of chest\ntightness associated with exertion. A stress MIBI SPECT\nstudy ordered by you demonstrated inferolateral mid and\nbasal inferior ischemia consistent with a left circumflex\ndistribution. The details of the study include an exercise\nprotocol for which the patient exercised for 7 minutes and\n15 seconds for 8.9 mets, with an increase in heart rate from\n74 to 159 (which is 94% of predicted peak heart rate), and\nincrease in blood pressure from 134\/80 to 210\/80 (with a\nrate pressure product of 33,390). The test was stopped due\nto fatigue and moderately severe chest pain. EKG\ndemonstrated 1.5mm of upsloping depression in II, III, F and\nV4-V5, and there were no noted arrhythmias.\n\nHer past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her\ncurrent medications include estrogen, Premarin, Provera, and\nverapamil 240mg q.d. A recent lipid panel demonstrated a\ntotal cholesterol of 203, LDL of 142, and an HDL of 39.\n\nOn physical examination, she is comfortable, well appearing\nwoman with a weight of 186 pounds, pulse 68 beats per minute\nand regular, blood pressure 140\/82 in the left arm. Jugular\nvenous pressure was approximately 6-8cm of water. Carotids\ndemonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits. Chest\nexamination was clear to auscultation. Heart examination\ndemonstrated a normal S1, positive S4, physiologically split\nS2, no murmurs or rubs. Abdominal examination was\n\n\nRE: Adler, Imogene\nMRN: 618-13-82-6\nPage 2\nMarch 23, 2079\n\n\n\nunremarkable. Peripheral examination demonstrated no\nperipheral examination and 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.\n\nEKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal\nEKG.\n\nI reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive\ncoronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the\nprobability of her having single vessel coronary artery\ndisease as the culprit for her chest pain. We reviewed the\noptions which include medical therapy and\/or coronary\nangiography and possible angioplasty. I made no solid\nrecommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty\napproach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead\nto curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical\ntherapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and\nI reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of\nsingle vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and\nonly affects the quality of life depending on the symptom\ntolerance. She and her husband are going to reflect on\nthese recommendations and get back to me by the end of the\nweek. If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography\nand possible angioplasty, we will schedule her immediately\nin Cardiology.\n\nI have scheduled follow-up in one month regardless to see\nher in the office.

For musculoskeletal pain I have recommended stretching exercises, and low dose diazepam for muscle contracture. She will avoid NSAID due to GI symptoms.\nAbdominal discomfort with diarrhea. The patient will follow a CHO diet and will avoid dairy products and other substances with low-absorption high-residue. In addition, in context of weakness I have recommended her to have a chemistry analysis for investigating electrolytes.
