I have been readjusting Mr. Geiger's blood pressure regimen since he left Hale Memorial Hospital for an episode of gastroenteritis and hypovolemia several months ago. His blood pressure regimen currently is HCTZ 25mg q.d, lisinopril, 20mg q.d. and atenolol 25mg q.d. He apparently went to an office visit at Dr. Mueller office a week ago and was noted there to have high blood pressure. She prescribed an increase in his atenolol from 25mg to 50mg. He has not yet completed that prescription. Mr. Geiger's blood pressure today is 180\/80. He denies any recent chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or other symptoms.\nMr. Geiger's cholesterol was checked by me last visit due to a modestly elevated cholesterol one year ago which had not been treated. His current cholesterol level was total 283, HDL 54, LDL 196.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Mr. Geiger denies any recent fever, chills, headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His blood pressure is 180\/80. His weight is 184. His heart rate is 80. Lung exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2, no murmurs. Abdominal exam is benign. Extremities show no evidence of edema.\nRecent laboratories show a chem 7 panel of sodium 141, potassium 4.5, chloride 101, bicarb 29, BUN 11, creatinine 1.1, glucose 124. He has a normal liver function test and normal calcium and magnesium. His T4 is normal at 10.3. His THBR is normal at 0.98.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Hypertension. Mr. Geiger's blood pressure continues to be elevated despite his current regimen of HCTZ and lisinopril and atenolol. He was recently given an increased atenolol dose from Dr. Mueller. I agree with this decision and will wait for him to fill his prescription and begin this new regimen before he follows up in a few weeks for blood pressure check. 2. Cholesterol. The patient's cholesterol is significantly elevated. Given his comorbidities, I would aim for an LDL level less than 130. Thus, I will begin a course of atorvastatin. His current liver function tests are normal.\nHALE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL Internal Medicine 35 Dearborn Street Geiger, Xian Rayne, MI 82978 01729440 01-14-77 Page 2\n3. Health maintenance. I have recommended to him losing some weight. He has gained 6 pounds since his visits last month. He attributes this to his holiday eating, but he says that he gets a good deal of exercise. I will continue to recommend diet and exercise for him. He has most recently competed a Pneumovax and a flu vaccine last week.\n\nNicholas Whaley, M.D.\nBS:HB1008; DD: 01-14-77; DT: 01-14-77; DV: 01-14-77\n\n* Record date: 2077-06-16\n\nHALE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL Internal Medicine 600 Dearborn Street Rayne, MI 82978\nGeiger, Xander 01729440 06\/16\/77\nMr. Geiger is a 75 year old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and panhypopituitarism who comes in today for follow up of his blood pressure. We have been titrating up his blood pressure meds over the past week. He is gone from 50mg of atenolol to 75 to 100mg with steady improvement in his blood pressure. His current regimen is atenolol 100q.d, HCTZ 25 q.d, lisinopril 20mg q.d. The patient has had no dizziness or other symptoms with increasing doses of atenolol.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His blood pressure is 160\/94. Heart rate is 64. Carotids 2+ without bruits. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac exam: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 with no murmurs. Abdomen is benign. Extremities: no edema.\nLaboratories: Cholesterol from June 11, 2077: total 171, HDL 57, LDL 86.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. Geiger is a very pleasant 75 year old man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia. 1. Hypertension. Blood pressure still elevated. I will increase lisinopril to 30mg q.d. Will also check a set of electrolytes at his next visit in 2 weeks when his blood pressure will be followed up. 2. Cholesterol. Well controlled at this time. 3. Health maintenance. The patient denies any colonoscopy in the past. I do not see one on record or in his history. We will arrange a screening colonoscopy. The patient has had recent PSA of 2.8 and a normal prostate exam by me last year. He is due for annual physical next month and will schedule this.\n\nNathan Whaley, M.D.\nNW:burns:06-74086442.doc; DD: 6\/16\/77; DT: 6\/17\/77; DV: 6\/16\/77\n\n\n* Record date: 2079-03-13\nHMH null GEIGER, XANDER Rayne, MI null 01729440 null 03\/13\/79\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a known history of hypopituitarism and hypertension who comes in today for routine annual exam. He states that he has been feeling exceptionally well. No history of chest pain, angina, dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, abdominal complaints. No difficulties in bowel habits, melena, BRBPR. No prostatic symptoms of urinary hesitancy or slow stream. He states that he has been carefully taking his prednisone and testosterone as prescribed, as well as his blood pressure medicines including lisinopril 40 q.d, atenolol 75 q.d, and his cholesterol medicine 10 of Lipitor q.d. He is no longer taking the hydrochlorothiazide that was prescribed to him in the past. He also states that he has run out of Synthroid and has not been taking that for the past several weeks.\nThe patient states that he is staying active, getting some exercise, continues to abstain from smoking or drinking, and has an appropriate diet.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On full review of systems, he denies any current concerns except for occasional difficulty maintaining an erection, which he states is not a significant problem for him.\nMEDICATIONS: Lipitor 10 q.d, testosterone q.3. weeks, prednisone 5 mg q.a.m. 2.5 mg q.p.m, lisinopril 40 mg q.d, and atenolol 75 mg q.d.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Panhypopituitarism secondary to macroadenoma resection and hypertension.\nHEALTH MAINTENANCE: Last cholesterol level 06\/2077, total 171 with an HDL of 57 and LDL of 86. The patient has not had a prior colonoscopy. Last PSA was less than assay 1 year ago.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well appearing, in no acute distress. Blood pressure elevated at 170\/84, heart rate 60. HEENT: Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Fundi are benign. Oropharynx is clear. Tympanic membranes are clear. Neck: Shows no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly. He does have a 3 x 3 cm cyst on his posterior neck that seems to be a lipoma. JVP is flat. Carotids are 2+ without bruits. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 normal, positive S4, 1\/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Abdomen: Midline scar status post some type of cord resection. Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly. Aorta is nonpalpable. There are no renal bruits. Femoral arteries are without bruits. GU: Testicles appear normal. Penis appears normal. Rectal: Guaiac negative brown stool. Prostate is smooth and nonenlarged. Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Normal sensation to vibratory in the feet.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old man who is overall doing extremely well except for his hypertension which is poorly controlled. I am unclear as to why he stopped his hydrochlorothiazide, but I think that this should be restarted as we do not have any further room with his lisinopril or atenolol. He will begin at 25 mg q.d. I will have his electrolytes checked today and come back and see me in 2 weeks' time for a repeat electrolyte check as well as blood pressure check, and further medication adjustment if necessary. We will also check urinalysis for protein as well as an EKG at this time given his hypertension.\nHyperlipidemia, on Lipitor. We will recheck cholesterol today.\nPanhypopituitarism. He seems to be doing well on his medications except that he stopped his TSH dose for unclear reasons. I have instructed him to restart his Synthroid and given him new prescriptions. We will recheck thyroid panel at this time.\nHealth maintenance. We will check a PSA and schedule a colonoscopy today.\nHe will return to clinic in 2 weeks' time for a BP check.\nNATHAN WHALEY, M.D.\neScription document:6-3377872\nDD: 03\/13\/79 DT: 03\/14\/79 DV: 03\/13\/79\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\n\n\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\n\n77 yo man here for fu pmhx of htn, panhypopit. no complaints today. he is taking all his meds except for his hctz. bp is high today. p of 60. plan to resume his hctz, check chol, tsh, psa, colonscopy. pt seen, discussed with resident, plan as above.\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2077-10-31\nCCU Admit Note\n\nXayavong, Brandon MR# 7826250\nDate of Admission: 10\/30\/77\nAttending: Dr. Umphrey\n\nID\/CC: 56yoM with anterior STEMI, s\/p lysis, cath showing large LAD plaque\n\nHPI: Mr Xayavong is a 56yoM with cardiac risk factors of DM, tobacco, HTN who presents from OSH with chest pain beginning at 10:30 the morning of admission.

BRIAN MOSS (772-261-4350)\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: fatigue, lightheadedness\n\nHISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS\nMr. Xayavong is a 61M h\/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p\/w ~3 days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.\n\nHe receives most of his care at Duluth Clinic-Hermantown (Dr. Moss). Two weeks ago, he had BiV\/ICD placement, as well as left heart catheterization that showed, per verbal report, &#8220;multivessel disease difficult for CABG.&#8221; He says he also had a chemical stress study but is unsure of the results. He reports that he was then referred to GNC for high-risk CABG (Dr. U. Wyatt) and potential heart transplant evaluation (Dr. A. Tyson).\n\nHe feels that since the BiV\/ICD placement he has been feeling more tired, specifically in the past 3 days, wherein he reports fatigue, nausea, poor sleep, exertional lightheadedness. He has not had chest pain (he did have chest pain with prior two MIs), palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea. He does have some orthopnea, but no PND and LE swelling intermittently, but not at present. To his knowledge, he has never had a tachyarrhythmia. However, he does note that he was started on digoxin a few weeks ago, tried it for 1 week, then had fatigue, nausea, GI upset, and that the medication was then discontinued.\n\nOn arrival, he had HR 135, BP 106\/73 with some drops to low of 80\/50. Felt to be VT versus Afib with aberrancy. EP was consulted, interrogated his device, and confirmed that he was in Afib (and that it had never fired or detected VT\/VF). He was given amio load 300 and drip at 1mg\/min, with some HR response to 100-120s. For hyperkalemia to 5.1, he was given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicard; and his Mg was repleted. Given his persistent symptoms, per EP recs, he was started on heparin drip with 5000 units bolus. (He is not on Coumadin at baseline; he takes toprol XL 12.5mg only.) CXR by report was clear. With admiodarone, BPs dropped to 75; upon discontinuation, BPs back up to 80s, then 90s. Of note, he says his baseline HR is 80s and SBP is 90s.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\nNegative in detail except as noted otherwise above.\n\nPAST MEDICAL\/SURGICAL HISTORY:\nCAD, h\/o STEMI 2077, 8 stents including LAD at least x2, BiV\/ICD placement 2 weeks ago, last cath Duluth 2 weeks with &#8220;multivessel disease not amenable to CABG&#8221;\nBiV\/ICD (DDD, St. Jude Promote RF, 5\/13\/81)\nCHF\nDM\nHTN\nFormer tobacco\n\nRECENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\nTTE, 11\/04\/2077:\nLA dil, LV: WMA anterior, septal, apical, no thrombus, delayed relaxation, EF 35%, RV nl\n\nInterventional LHC, 10\/2077: Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with a\n3.5 x 15 and 3.0 x 15 mm Vision stents.\n\nLHC, 10\/2077:\nDominance: Right\nLeft Main: normal.\nLAD: diffuse, irregular, and thrombotic 90 % stenosis in its proximal third.\nD1: focal 90 % stenosis in its ostium\nRamus: focal 95 % stenosis in its ostium.\nBoth the 1st Diagonal and Ramus side branches arise from the thrombotic Proximal LAD segment.\nCx\/RCA: minimal irregularities\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Heart disease on both mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s side, but no early CAD in 1st degree relatives.

He has been followed by Dr. Ashlei Tyson for the possibility of cardiac transplantation and has intermittently been admitted to GNC. He was admitted to GNC from 6\/13\/82 to 6\/19\/82 after being found to be in atrial fibrillation with hypotension, fatigue, and nausea; this was 2 weeks after the placement of his BiV ICD. He converted to sinus rhythm after amiodarone was administered, but developed a marked transaminitis. Due to elevated filling pressures (PCWP 23), he required IV Lasix for diuresis. He was felt to be a poor candidate for CABG given the degree of heart failure, so transplantation was instead pursued. He was also admitted to GNC from 11\/10\/82 through 11\/13\/82 after again being found with elevated filling pressures after complaining of fatigue (PCWP 37); he received a PA line and required a Lasix drip and IV nitroprusside. At the time of discharge, his reported dry weight was 206 lbs.\n\nHe came for a scheduled right-sided heart catheterization today as he has had increasing complaint of fatigue. He reports that he has been feeling &#8220;lousy,&#8221; that his appetite has been &#8220;crummy,&#8221; and that he is &#8220;feeling real tired.&#8221; He feels that these symptoms have been relatively severe but unchanged for the past 2 years. He denies overt shortness of breath, but essentially fatigues very easily with physical exertion, and has been requiring multiple naps a day. He states that he has been careful with his diet (both fluid and salt intake) without any changes, and that he has been entirely compliant with his medications. Of note, his cardiologist attempted to change him from Toprol XL to Coreg several months ago, and that seems to have made him feel worse. He continues to urinate to his home Lasix dosing. He denies any sensation of chest pain or chest pressure, and denies chest palpitations or sensation of fluttering; he states clearly that he could tell when his heart was in an abnormal rhythm in 6\/72. He says that his pacemaker was &#8220;checked&#8221; last week and that he was told he didn&#8217;t have any &#8220;episodes.&#8221; He believes that he has been putting on weight recently, and reports that his baseline weight is ~225 lbs. He denies recent fevers or chills. He has no complaint of leg swelling.\n\nPAST MEDICAL\/SURGICAL HISTORY\nCAD\nSTEMI 2077 s\/p 2 stents to the LAD (done at GNC) Reports 2 other MI&#8217;s (2079 and 2080, treated at OCH) Reportedly s\/p ~8 stents in total after various interventions Per report, multi-vessel disease &#8220;difficult for CABG&#8221; 5\/82\nCHF\n\nBiV ICD placement DDD 5\/13\/2082 Class D, Stage III\nDiabetes\nChronic Renal Insufficiency\n\nh\/o Latent Tuberculosis\n\ns\/p Toe Amputation x2\nLast one was taken off several months ago secondary to infection\ns\/p Fused L Ankle\n\nRECENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\nCardiac Catheterization (10\/30\/77)\nDominance: Right\n\nLeft Main: The left main coronary artery is of moderate length, intermediate\nsized vessel.

Since her discharge from the hospital in September, she has noticed that she is fatigue with exertion but has had no chest pressure and no exertional diaphoresis, nausea, or jaw pain. She does note occasional lightheadedness throughout the day, this is not related to position or going from sitting to standing position. As you are aware, her MIBI test showed very small amount of ischemia almost undetectable in amount. Her medical regimen includes Lasix 40 mg po q.d, Lisinopril 20 mg po q.d, 125 mg of hydrochlorothiazide b.i.d. Of note, she was taking an additional Lisinopril at 20 mg po b.i.d. Labetalol 200 mg b.i.d, Isordil 40 t.i.d, Prilosec 20 mg po q.d, Cisapride 10 mg po q.d, simvastatin 10 mg po q.d, aspirin 325 mg po q.d. On physical exam, her blood pressure is 140\/90 right and left arm seated, heart rate is 77 and irregular, respiratory rate is 12. There is no increase in jugular venous pressure. Carotids are free of bruits. Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout. Cardiac exam is notable for distant heart sounds with no S3, S4. Abdomen is soft and nontender. The extremities are free of edema. Electrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block unchanged from prior electrocardiograms. In summary, Shilpa Pickett certainly has cardiovascular risk factors of sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, high cholesterol and increase in weight. We will be rechecking her lipid profile today. She reports to me that she has absolutely no appetite for the foods she usually eats and has occasionally had trouble eating. She notes no dysphoria and no other signs or symptoms of depression. She has had no change in her hair or skin. For the Pickett, Shilpa MR #129-53-47-3 -2- October 13, 2061 moment, I will be reviewing her SMA 20 for evidence of liver dysfunction but would strongly consider both depression and hyperthyroidism for further workup of this loss of appetite. It is certainly a pleasure for me to participate in Shilpa Pickett' care. Let me know if there are any questions or issues I can be of help with.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT: Seventy-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease complaining about syncopal episode today. The patient states that over the last couple of weeks she has had increased chest palpitations and two weeks ago was given an event monitor which he has intermittently worn saying it is difficult to wear during the heat wave. This a.m. the patient had a syncopal episode while watching a disagreement between her two grandchildren. The patient states had no chest pain, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting. The patient fell to the floor and awoke, denies incontinence or tongue biting. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, CVA. MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Lasix, Lopressor, Isordil, insulin, lisinopril, Colace, nitroglycerin sublingual, Cisapride, Prilosec. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well developed, well nourished female with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. HEENT normocephalic, atraumatic. Neck supple without spinal tenderness. Heart regular rate and rhythm, positive 2\/6 systolic ejection murmur. Chest is clear. Abdomen is soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds. Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Neuro alert and oriented times three, good motor strength throughout, sensory intact, no focality. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Syncopal episode most likely cardiac in origin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She states that she has not been feeling well since her upper respiratory tract infection. She had the flu in January and then developed another upper respiratory tract infection a couple of weeks ago. She states that this has severely debilitated her. She is complaining of occasional nonproductive cough, post nasal drip, and occasional dull headache. However, her main concern is her stomach and her back. Ms. Pickett continues to have postprandial nausea and discomfort in her epigastrium, particularly after eating. This is different than her reflux disease, which she feels is under fairly good control, with the Prilosec-Propulsid combination. She is describing some anorexia, although she has not lost any weight. She has not had any alterations in her bowel movements. She has not been constipated or had diarrhea. She wonders whether this could be in gallbladder. In addition, she is continuing to have some back pain with radiation down her left leg in the L5\/S1 distribution. She had one epidural steroid injection but was due to go back. Given her upper respiratory tract infection, this was postponed. She is not having any heart symptoms or shortness of breath. Her sugars have been under good control, ranging between 111 and 143. Her blood pressure is 152\/70 today, with a pulse of 70. She is saturating well. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam, lungs were clear to auscultation. There was no JVD. Heart: regular rate and rhythm with positive S4? S3 with no significant murmur. Abdomen was soft, nondistended, with some mild tenderness without rebound or guarding over the right upper quadrant. Abdomen was somewhat bloated per patient and diffusely tender. Extremities revealed some mild pedal edema left greater than right. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A seventy-one-year-old woman with multiple medical issues, including coronary artery disease, CHF, diabetes, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease. She came in today for discussion of her ongoing lumbar radiculopathic pain as well as her abdominal complaint. With regard to her back pain, she wanted a prescription for Tylenol with codeine, which has helped in the past. I gave her a prescription. I warned her about the possible side effects of constipation. She should contact the pain clinic as soon as she feels able, for a repeat epidural steroid injection. With regard to her abdominal complaints, the bubbling in her chest, postprandial nausea and anorexia could certainly be due to gallbladder disease. Unclear contribution from her reflux. Dr. Mario Robison recommended elective cholecystectomy. Given the fact that Ms. Pickett is being more and more bothered by these symptoms, it may be reasonable to EASLEY BAPTIST HOSPITAL Pickett, Silpa 12953473 03-20-63 page 2 consider her for the surgery. I have asked her to call Dr. Xiques and make an appointment to discuss her cardiovascular risk so that she can make an informed decision about the surgery. She is otherwise up to date with her issues and doing relatively well from a cardiovascular and diabetic perspective. She would probably do better with lower blood pressure. We could consider increasing her Imdur. I plan to follow up with her in a few weeks time.

The pain was primarily in his back, similar to his angina prior to stenting. The pain lasted for approximately 30 min despite SL NTG, although did go away eventually. He had diaphoresis, SOB, and blurred vision associated with the pain. He was brought to the ED by his family. On arrival, he was pain free. P 60 BP 110\/70. He was treated with ASA and Lopressor. EKG was unremarkable. Two sets of markers were negative. He is admitted to complete rule out MI and further diagnostic testing.\n\nHe currently denies pain and feels back to his baseline.

His cardiac history dates back to March 2095 when he experienced dyspnea and exertional chest pressure that radiated to his jaw and arms. Cardiac catheterization at that time showed LAD disease and he underwent PTCA\/Taxus stent to his LAD.\nHe did well until August 2096 when he presented with a dull mid scapular discomfort that radiated to his upper chest. These symptoms were accompanied by diaphoresis, dyspnea and transient blurry vision. After evaluation and clearance by Neurology he underwent another cardiac catheterization. Catheterization revealed his LAD stent was patent but he had a 90% lesion proximal to the stent. He had PTCA\/Vision stent to his LAD.\nSince 11\/19\/2096 he has had complaints of increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure. He was treated with antibiotics and prednisone with relief of his dyspnea. He continues with daily exertional chest discomfort that resolves with rest and sl nitroglycerin.\nToday he presented for elective cardiac catheterization which show ed a proximal 90% occlusion and mild In stent restenosis. He had a cypher stent placed in his LAD.

He is complaining of a funny sensation in his neck and occasional soreness in his left neck. Sometimes it hurts worse with breathing. Sometimes he feels a little catch and a fleeting moment of shortness of breath. Of note, he was admitted to the hospital last week for these symptoms. He was admitted, I think 01\/15-01\/16. He was ruled out for an MI and actually had a stress test, which showed no evidence of ischemia. Furthermore, he was monitored the entire time, including while he was having this symptom of a funny feeling in his chest followed by a little shortness of breath or catching his breath as he describes it and no arrhythmia was documented whatsoever. He was ultimately discharged from the hospital with the diagnosis of Costa chondritis. He is describing this pain in his left neck and he wonders if it is somehow related to the pain in his chest. He said he tried gargling with mouthwash some and that did seem to help a little. This neck or throat pain has been going on for the past three days.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for osteoarthritis, hypertension and other noncontributory problems.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Aspirin, atenolol, Lipitor and vitamin E.\n\nALLERGIES: None.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Today, he is alert and oriented. His weight is 255.25 pounds, blood pressure 110\/80, pulse 68, temperature 97.4. Sinuses: Non-tender. Nasal turbinates: Benign. Tympanic membranes: With good light reflex, landmarks well seen. Oropharynx: Without erythema, exudate, edema. Neck: Supple, without adenopathy. I am able to locate the spot that's bothering him by pressing on the mid outside of his left neck near where his carotid pulse is, but he does not have a lot of discomfort with this pressure and it does not seem to be quite what he is getting at. Carotids are 2+ bilaterally. Lungs: Clear to auscultation and percussion throughout. Heart: Regular, without murmur, rub or gallop.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: I was unable to find a clear etiology for Mr. Quevedo discomfort, although I think he is probably right that it is related to the musculoskeletal chest pain that he is having. I did reassure him and tell him that it was okay for him to take ibuprofen for this as he had been directed in the hospital. He does have an appointment to see Dr. Potter in follow-up in the next couple weeks and he will call or return if any new symptoms develop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRawan Pineda, M.D.\n\n\nDictated By: Rawan Pineda\n\n\neScription document:6-3221670 JSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 01\/23\/83\nDT: 01\/23\/83\nDV: 01\/23\/83\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2082-06-29\nCKMC EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT UHRICH,KARSON 456-30-26-8 VISIT DATE: 06\/29\/82 The patient was seen and evaluated with the medical intern, I agree with the medical intern's note. PRESENTING COMPLAINT: The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, depression, H pylori, gastric reflux with increasing back pain and epigastric pain. HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT: She says over the last couple of days it is unrelieved with food but not exacerbated by food.

Albright, M.D. Columbia Kingwood Medical Center 57 Wood St, Q6-24 North Andover, KY 41454\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with past medical history notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia, but no coronary artery disease who presents with a three-day history of progressive weakness and lightheadedness. The history is obtained in Spanish from the patient and through her daughter who assisted with translation. In general, she has apparently been doing well with no episodes of chest discomfort or exertional dyspnea until roughly three days ago when she has began to notice episodic problems with walking even short distances before she feels as though she might pass out. The episodes have occurred multiple times per day and after a particularly severe episode this morning, she brought her mother to the emergency department for evaluation. There have been no syncopal episodes and no complaints of palpitations, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema. The patient has not had symptoms like this before and has been chronically treated with atenolol for hypertension for many years.\nHer only cardiovascular evaluation has been with adenosine MIBI in 2085, which revealed normal systolic function and no evidence for ischemia.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastritis, and osteoarthritis. She also carries the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is not currently treated for this.\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Included amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg at bedtime, hydrochlorothiazide\/lisinopril 25\/20 one tablet daily, loratadine 10 mg daily, and Protonix 40 mg daily.\nShe developed gastrointestinal irritation with higher doses of aspirin.\nSOCIAL AND FAMILY HISTORY: As noted in the housestaff notes.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In the Emergency Department, her heart rate is 38 beats per minute and her blood pressure is 110\/70 mmHg. Her venous pressures are low and there are BLANK waves present every other beat. The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam reveals bradycardia with normal S1, wide physiologically split S2, and an audible S4. There is no murmur. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The liver is not palpably enlarged. The extremities are warm without edema.\nElectrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm with 2:1 AV block and right bundle-branch block. There is left axis deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block.\nThere is no response of her heart rate to mild calisthenics in the bed.\nLaboratories are notable for normal BUN to creatinine ratio of 23\/1.2 with a potassium of 4.1 and a hematocrit of 35%. Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative.\nIn summary, Karson Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents with a three-day history of presyncope and weakness in the context of a new diagnosis of 2:1 AV block. Review of previous electrocardiograms reveals no right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block and of late this represents progression of her underlying conduction system disease. We will proceed to permanent temporary pacemaker implantation for backup support and will arrange electrophysiologic consultation for permanent pacemaker implantation. There is no history to suggest an ischemic syndrome, so I did not think additional pharmacologic stress test is necessary. Her beta-blocker will be held overnight in addition to her amitriptyline to see if this facilitates recovery of her AV nodal function. Overall, I think this likely represents infra-hisian block and a pacemaker should be curative therapy. Additional plans will be dictated by her clinical course.\n\nXavier Alvin Kaufman, MD\n\n\n\n\neScription document:3-6100190 IFFocus\nCC: Owen Quentin-Xiong M.D. Columbia Kingwood Medical 35 Wood St North Andover, KY 41454\n\nDD: 09\/28\/90 DT: 09\/28\/90 DV: 09\/28\/90\n\n* Record date: 2092-05-05\n05\/05\/2092 Spanish 81 Wood St UHRICH, KARSON North Andover, KY 41454 45630268 (884) 486-9594 07\/01\/2091 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Uhrich is 75.

A lot has happened since I last saw him in 10\/2119. A CTA revealed severe stenosis of his left ICA. He is status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies and also has known vertebral disease with a history of a left occipital stroke. He subsequently was referred to Dr. Mccarthy and was scheduled to undergo left ICA stent placement in December. In November 1 morning after going to the bathroom he developed sudden onset of vertigo. His wife called 911. He continued to have positional vertigo in the emergency room such that if he sat up he would become very vertiginous and off balance but if he laid with his eyes closed. He felt better. He was found to be orthostatic and his symptoms improved according to the chart by the next day though according to the patient, it took a couple of days for his symptoms to improve significantly. An MRI of the brain was unrevealing for ischemia. Although he significantly improved he still feels &#34;a little off balance&#34;. He is fine when he is sitting but he notes when he stands up he just &#34;feels off&#34;. He does not feel acutely vertiginous and does not have any sense of movement but does not feel as steady as he used to on his feet. He has seen Guy in physical therapy and is working on balance therapy. He subsequently did undergo left ICA stent placement on 12\/22\/2119 without any complication. There was no worsening of his sense of imbalance or no new neurologic symptoms. Also of note, I neglected to mention above, that when he became acutely vertiginous in November there were no other accompanying symptoms. He was discharged after his left carotid endarterectomy on Plavix as well as aspirin that he had been on prior to his admission. He also was switched while in the hospital from hydrochlorothiazide to Inderal for blood pressure control although he was orthostatic sitting up. Lying down he was hypertensive. He has had no new neurologic symptoms since his discharge from NDMG after his carotid endarterectomy on 12\/22\/2119.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, gemfibrozil, nifedipine, Plavix, propranolol, ranitidine.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pleasant, healthy-appearing 74-year-old male. Blood pressure 160\/90 sitting, standing 155\/90. Cranial nerve examination notable for right homonymous hemianopsia. Auscultation of the neck: Unremarkable. No bruits. There are bilateral CEA scars. Motor examination: No drift. Power 5\/5 throughout. Fine finger movements intact. In the lower extremities. Power 5\/5 on the right. The left he is status post left knee fusion. The left iliopsoas and dorsiflexion are full strength. His gait shows left limp due to knee fusion, but he appears steady. DTRs 1+ throughout.\nDATA: MRI of the brain in 11\/2119 shows chronic left occipital lobe infarct otherwise unremarkable. CTA of the head and neck 11\/14\/2119 showed stable left PCA territory chronic infarct with encephalomalacia and nonspecific periventricular white matter hypoattenuation as previously described. CTA of the head showed stable moderate stenosis of the left supraclinoid ICA. Stable occlusion or near occlusion of the left vertebral artery at the dural penetration to the take off of the PICA. There is reconstruction of contrast in the distal aspect. There is moderate stenosis of the distal left interdural vertebral artery with severe stenosis at the left vertebrobasilar junction and also unchanged. Stable moderate to severe stenosis within the right intradural vertebral artery. Mild areas of stenosis within the basilar artery and left T1 and T2 segments also unchanged. A CTA of the neck shows a short segment of severe stenosis of the proximal left ICA, which is stable since the most recent study. The right carotid artery demonstrates no significant stenosis. Dominant right vertebral artery with hypoplastic left vertebral artery demonstrates moderate stenosis at its origin and diffuse areas of moderate stenosis of the throughout unchanged. Mild to moderate right subclavian artery stenosis just proximal to the vertebral artery take off unchanged. Multiple thyroid nodules as described since most recent study. New ground glass nodule in the lower lobe the right lung, which is likely inflammatory in nature. Followup chest x-ray 11\/14\/2119 was unremarkable. Cardiac ultrasound shows evidence of a PFO, which is now noted following performance of Valsalva maneuver not previously noted. In 09\/2113 Holter monitor was unremarkable.\nIMPRESSION: A 74-year-old male with long-standing cerebrovascular disease and history notable for left occipital lobe infarct with vertebrobasilar disease as described above, status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies with recent restenosis on the left treated with stenting in 12\/2119. He has been doing well considering.\nThe cause of his episode of vertigo and imbalance is unclear. It is difficulty to tease out whether or not this was a posterior circulation TIA versus small stroke not detected on MRI versus vasovagal etiology. He checks out well today and I do not find any new findings on examination and his walking is steady though subjectively he feels he is not quite back to baseline. Agree with Plavix added to his aspirin dose after his carotid stent placement. His blood pressure is a little high today. He will be following up with Dr. Kinney in 2 weeks.

Briefly, this is a 54-year-old female with a known mass in her vagina, who presents now with vaginal bleeding. The patient was seen earlier yesterday by the Oncology service, and is scheduled to have surgery for the mass to be removed, but she developed significant vaginal bleeding and presented to the Emergency Department today. She is otherwise healthy. Her first time seen in the Emergency Department or seen by Oncology was two weeks ago for increased bleeding. She was diagnosed at the time with a necrotic fibroid, and was confirmed by studies to have a large fibroid at that time. She now presents with increasing weakness and light-headedness and more bleeding. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: In the Emergency Department, an IV was started, and laboratory studies sent, including CBC, electrolytes, PT\/PTT, and she was also typed and crossed and a urinalysis sent. A chest x-ray and EKG were sent. The patient was made n.p.o. She is a preoperative patient. Her initial hematocrit here was 23. A full note was written by the Oncology service, and she is currently admitted to that service. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Vaginal bleeding with necrotic leiomyoma. DISPOSITION (including condition on discharge): As above. The patient's condition on admission is stable. CQ774\/2253 TRISTAN O. XAVIER, M.D. TX12 D:10\/13\/78 T:10\/13\/78 Dictated by: TRISTAN O.

Mrs. Yarbrough is 55 years old. Over the past year she had had menorrhagia and underwent endometrial biopsy in September of 2078 followed by total abdominal hysterectomy in early October of 2078. Her post-operative course was complicated by a pelvic abscess for which she was rehospitalized in late October and during that hospitalization had an episode of atrial fibrillation which reverted spontaneously to sinus rhythm. The episode was accompanied by some substernal chest heaviness but no other symptoms and she was not aware of any palpitations. She was placed on verapamil 240 mg daily and has not had any symptomatic recurrences. Her abdominal incision is open but healing and she has been recovering well. She has no prior cardiac history. She specifically denies any exertional chest pain, palpitations, or transient neurologic symptoms. She can climb a flight of stairs at her own pace but is mildly dyspneic at the top of the stairs. She feels that her exertional capacity has increased somewhat over the past year and a half since she stopped smoking. She does not have a known history of hypertension, however VNA has been documenting blood pressures in the range of 130 to 190 mm Hg systolic with diastolic pressures ranging from 72 to 110 mm Hg despite therapy with verapamil. There is no prior history of syncope. Page Two RE:IRENE YARBROUGH CDH#810 86 43 7 November 10, 2078 Her current medications are verapamil 240 mg daily as above and Premarin. She has GI intolerance to several analgesic medications. She previously smoked two packs per day but quit a year and a half ago of her own volition without any particular change in her health precipitating this. She rarely drinks ethanol. She has not had any prior surgeries. Family history is negative for premature coronary artery disease. Review of systems is negative for thyroid disease and a TSH was normal during her last admission. Physical examination reveals a healthy-appearing obese woman sitting comfortably with a blood pressure of 140\/90, heart rate 73 and regular. HEENT is externally unremarkable. There is no lid lag and no thyromegaly. Carotids are palpable bilaterally. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac exam reveals somewhat distant heart tones and I am not able to palpate the apical impulse. There is a soft systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a healing surgical incision in the lower abdomen. Extremities are without edema. Dorsalis pedis pulses are easily palpable. The 12-lead electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at 73 bpm with a PR interval of .18, QRS .08. There are low amplitude T waves in the lateral precordium and inverted T waves in I and aVL with slightly leftward axis. An echocardiogram performed during her last hospitalization was normal, although with some mild evidence of ventricular hypertrophy. My impression is that Ms. Yarbrough has had one episode of atrial fibrillation in the perioperative period. She probably has mild labile hypertension which has not been previously treated. This would explain her electrocardiographic changes and the echocardiogram as well as the possible predisposition to atrial fibrillation. I took the liberty of switching her from verapamil 240 mg daily to atenolol 50 mg daily. Once her incision is further healed we will arrange for her to have an exercise tolerance test to get some reassurance regarding the possible co-existence of coronary artery disease in view of her mild electrocardiographic abnormalities in atrial fibrillation. Page Three RE:IRENE YARBROUGH CDH#810 86 43 7 November 10, 2078 will see her again in six weeks at which time she will have the exercise tolerance test. We cautioned her to take her pulse on a daily basis and report to us if it becomes irregular and rapid. We also gave her a prescription for nitroglycerin 0.4 mg and instructions on how to take this medication in the event of a recurrence of the substernal chest discomfort which accompanied her transient atrial fibrillation. Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in her care. Sincerely, Paul N.

The Chief Complaint, History of Present Illness, Past Medical History, Medications, Allergies, Social History, Family History and Review of Systems are as noted by Dr. Nettles on the record and were reviewed with him and with the patient. Briefly, this is a 55 year old woman who presented with chest pain which was epigastric and substernal in nature, essentially sharp and non-radiating that had come on at rest. She has several cardiac risk factors including hypertension, obesity and hormone replacement but had no specific cardiac history. Her symptoms did not resolve with Mylanta. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: As noted by Dr. Nettles and is most noteworthy for normal heart sounds, although she does have a II\/VI systolic ejection murmur at the apex (the upper right sternal border). LABORATORY EVALUATION: An electrocardiogram does not show acute changes but does have T wave inversions in V1 to V3. These were previously noted in 10\/78. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: The patient required nitroglycerine and nitroglycerine, IV nitroglycerine and IV heparin with some morphine to relieve her pain. She also received Lopressor 25 mg IV and was given some GI meds. She eventually became pain-free, although she does admit to a residual mild discomfort in her chest. There are no electrocardiographic changes. IMPRESSION: I concur with Dr. Nettles that this patient has chest pain suspicious for unstable angina. She has responded well to aggressive treatment of this and she will be admitted for further evaluation. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Chest pain. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): Admission. Condition satisfactory. MR190\/0660 ANTHONY G. PETTY, M.D. AP06 D:03\/10\/79 T:03\/10\/79 Dictated by: ANTHONY G.

Trujillo, M.D.\nDepartment of Vascular Surgery\nLenox Care Center\n21 Tamworth Place\nGalena, MN 64864\n\nDear Dr. Trujillo:\n\nThank you for referring Mrs. Shirley Trent, a 68-year-old lady\nwith peripheral artery disease, on whom you plan to do\nrevascularization of the right leg. Her history is well known to\nyou but I will repeat it for our records. She has a long history\nof cigarette smoking with a 3-packet-per-day history for 30\nyears, stopping 15 years ago. She has developed claudication,\nparticularly in the right leg, over the last year since her\nhusband died, which has all the typical symptoms and is relieved\nby rest. This seems predominantly in the right calf but is also\nin the right thigh as well. She had segmental leg pressures done\nwhich shows some mild diminution in the left leg but an\nankle-brachial index of 0.65 in the right leg. An MR angiogram\nshowed stenosis, although I do not have the full report on this\nas yet.\n\nShe has intercurrent problems with insulin-dependent diabetes\nmellitus, which she has had for 10 years. Her other cardiac risk\nfactors apart from cigarette smoking include a family history of\nmyocardial infarction in her father, and it is uncertain what her\ncholesterol level is. She has no history of hypertension,\nalthough I am uncertain whether this has been checked in the\npast. She has a past history of partial gastrectomy in 2059 for\na bleeding peptic ulcer and this has led to some difficulty in\nswallowing tablets and keeping them down. She also has a past\nhistory of a right middle lobectomy in 2079 for adenocarcinoma\nthat had clear margins and did not require further adjunctive\ntherapy. She also had a cholecystectomy in 2079, which was\nuneventful.\n\nSystems review reveal no chest discomfort, dyspnea, ankle edema,\npalpitations, syncope, cough, sputum, hemoptysis, GI bleeding,\nweakness down the arms, face, or legs, seizures or visual\ndisturbances, and all other systems are negative.\n\nShe lives alone, and her current medications include insulin\nonly. She has no allergies.\n\nOn physical examination, she is alert and orientated without any\nsigns of jaundice, clubbing, or cyanosis. Her heart rate was 85\nbeats per minute with a blood pressure of 160\/85 in both arms.\nThe jugular venous pressure was not elevated, and her carotid\nupstrokes were reduced, but she had no bruits audible. Her apex\nbeat was not palpable, and she had a normal first and second\nheart sound without added sounds, murmurs, or gallops. Her chest\nwas clear to percussion and auscultation. She had no\nhepatosplenomegaly and no abdominal masses or pulsations. She\nhad the scars from previous operations present. Her femoral\npulses were absent on the right side and reduced on the left side\nwithout bruits. She had reduced but palpable dorsalis pedis and\nposterior tibial pulses on the left leg but no pedal pulses on\nthe right leg. There were no trophic changes in her legs. She\nhad reduced sensation to pinprick in both feet to the mid calf\nlevel in a stocking distribution.\n\nHer ECG showed sinus rhythm without abnormalities.\n\nAssessment: This lady obviously has severe claudication and\nrequires revascularization, but is uncertain whether she has any\nmyocardial ischemia. I therefore think a stress test is\nrequired. She also has difficulty in swallowing medications and\nthis will prove a problem for the long-term management of her\natherosclerosis, which I would like to further evaluate.\n\nPlan: I therefore organized a dobutamine stress test to assess\nfor myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular risk. I have also\nasked her to start on a small dose of a beta-blocker for reducing\nher perioperative risk as well as treating her blood pressure,\nwhich is elevated. I have also asked her to have a fasting blood\nlipid test today so we can assess her cholesterol level, as it is\nlikely that she would benefit from lipid-lowering therapy. I\nplan to evaluate all these in approximately a month or so after\nher operation so that we can manage her in the long term.\n\nI will let you know the results of her stress test when they\nbecome available. Thank you for allowing me to take part in this\nlady's care.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDictated By: James Patel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Patel, MBBS, PHD\n\n\neScription document:8-6022994 TFFocus\n\n\nCC: Rose Samuel Isaac-Ly M.D.\nInternal Medicine\n20 Tamworth Place\nGalena, MN 64864\n\nDD: 09\/21\/92\nDT: 09\/21\/92\nDV: 09\/21\/92\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2093-06-12\nDutch 19 Tamworth Place TRENT, SHIRLEY Galena, MN 64864 99210914 (676) 312-7662 06\/12\/93\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Trent is 69, a pleasant lady who is now a widow well known to me for her insulin-dependent diabetes and her poor compliance with treatment. In the past, she also has experienced upper GI bleeding due to a peptic ulcer and has undergone cholecystectomy as well as lobectomy for carcinoma of the lung.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Humulin N 25 units in the morning. She is supposed to be using 28 units in the morning and 8 units in the evening depending on blood sugars. She also has been prescribed an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker, which she has neglected to take. Her last visit to the practice was in September of last year.\nAt the time of her last visit, I referred to vascular surgery because of claudication of the right leg. She underwent a femoral public TL bypass in December and did well postoperatively. She was discharged on simvastatin, Plavix, as well as atenolol and lisinopril. She abandoned all tablets on her own and did not come for her followup appointment with us. Today, she tells me that claudication in the right leg has disappeared completely but during the past two months, she has begun noticing pain in the left leg after 10-15 minutes of walking which forces her to stop. An arteriogram carried out in September of last year showed mild diffuse disease involving the left common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral arteries. She did not have symptoms on the left side at the time.\nThe patient denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and ankle edema. Prior to her bypass surgery on the right leg, she underwent a Persantine MIBI which showed only 1 mm ST depressions and was considered not diagnostic.\nMs. Trent has experienced some polyuria and mild polydipsia and has two times nocturia. She denies dysuria. The last hemoglobin A1c was 8.4 in September of last year. At that time, her serum cholesterol was 238, HDL was 59, and triglycerides were 263.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Today, she is pleasant and talkative. Her weight is 127-1\/2 pounds, blood pressure 180\/76, and heart rate is 96. Oxygen saturation 100% on room air. Random fingerstick glucose is 202. Extraocular movements are full. The thyroid is not enlarged. The neck veins are flat. The chest is clear to auscultation. The breasts are free of masses. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy. The heart sounds are regular. There are no rubs or gallops. There is a midline abdominal scar which corresponds to an old operation for peptic ulcer. There is also a right upper quadrant cholecystectomy scar which is surrounded by a mass, which has been present in the past that probably represents fibrosis under the scar. No other masses are palpable. The lower extremities are free of edema. I do not palpate the pulse except in the dorsalis pedis area of the right side, but there are no trophic changes and the skin is warm and pink.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A 69-year-old widow lady with moderately controlled insulin-dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia. She has not been compliant with her medications. She has suffered from peripheral vascular disease and claudication in the past underwent a bypass surgery on the right lower extremity in October of last year. She now has mild symptoms of claudication on the left. She continues to consume three or four beers a day. The relationship to her vascular atherosclerosis is not clear. Liver function in the past has been normal and she does not have significant proteinuria. Today, I have repeated her hemoglobin A1c, comprehensive panel, CBC, and urine analysis. I have spent 20 minutes speaking to her and to her daughter concerning the importance of compliance and explaining the rationale for the lisinopril. I have prescribed Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d, lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d, and enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. She is also to take a multivitamin q.d. I will see her again after the above test results to decide whether we need to adjust her medications. I have increased her insulin to 28 units every morning. She will come to see the nurse practitioner in three days' time to learn how to use a glucometer and to review diabetes care. An electrocardiogram will be obtained and a consultation will be arranged with vascular surgery concerning the claudication now on the left leg.\n\n\nRose Irvin-Ly, M.D.\nDictated By: Rose Irvin-Ly\neScription document:0-2524422 EMSSten Tel\n\nDD: 06\/12\/93 DT: 06\/13\/93 DV: 06\/12\/93\n\n* Record date: 2093-11-24\n\nHistory of Present Illness\nAsked by Dr. Trujillo to comment on diabetes management for this patient.

The patient's grand-nephew is translating, initially, then joined by Dutch interpreter; history is challenging to obtain. The patient reports that since she awoke in the AM on 12\/07\/94, she noticed that her RUE and RLE was weak and numb. She apparently had come to the ED about 2 days ago for RLE numbness and pain which has been worsening over the past 1-2 months, but reportedly had good strength on neurological exam, and she was not admitted. She was given a 2-day course of Levaquin for UTI. She states that despite the pain in the RLE 2 days ago, she was able to move her RLE whereas since yesterday she has not been able to move it as easily or bear weight. She also noted that her RUE was weak, and she was unable to raise it very far off the bed. She was unable to walk independently since yesterday, and required full assistance of her son to walk to the bathroom. She has had no facial weakness. She has never had weakness of this kind in her right arm or leg, but had similar weakness in the left arm and leg in 2089 which completely resolved. She states that she has had a mild right-sided headache since yesterday AM. Since this morning, she has had nausea and vomiting as well (did not have this yesterday), and has not had any fevers or chest pain. She has had SOB today. She reports having frequent BLE spasms, usually at night, and her legs become quite restless.\n\nROS:\nGen: No fevers\/chills\/sweats, CP, palpitations, N\/V, URI, cough, abd pain, dysuria, melena, BRBPR, rash, travel\n\nNeurological: Recent RLE pain as above.

No significant periventricular white matter changes are\nevident.\n\n\nIMPRESSION: 70 year-old right-handed female with h\/o DM, PVD presenting to ED for RUE and RLE numbness and weakness, onset 12\/07\/94 AM. She has had numbness\/tingling and shooting pain in the RLE for the past 1-2 months likely due to disease in the lumbar spine seen on MRI (L5-S1). She states that the current weakness in the RLE is new, as is the weakness in the RUE. Additionally, she has new nausea\/vomiting and SOB since this AM. While in the ED, following her CT scans, she was tachycardic to the 150s and hypertensive to the 230s systolic. She had persistent nausea and vomiting.\n\nHer neurological exam was difficult with inconsistent findings. She appears to have decreased spontaneous movement of the RUE, but when passively moved into shoulder flexion she was able to hold the position against gravity for several seconds. Her RLE symptoms are likely confounded by her lumbar spine disease at L5\/S1 as noted above. She is hyperglycemic (serum glucose 313), has a mild leukocytosis, is iron deficient, and has new onset today of fairly severe nausea\/vomiting and SOB of unclear etiology. She appears to have vasculopathic changes\/lacunes in the brain seen as hypodensities on the CT today, all appearing old. She does not have any right facial weakness, no dysarthria, no aphasia, no flaccidity\/spasticity, no gaze preference. While stroke can not be ruled out, her exam does not clearly suggest a typical stroke syndrome. Ddx includes seizure, infection or metabolic abnormality causing unmasking of stroke-like symptoms, migraine phenomena superimposed on current medical\/metabolic abnormalities.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. MRI\/MRA of the head and neck (stroke protocol), as well as MRI of C-spine given UE symptoms\n2. We currently recommend admission to medicine given multiple medical issues (severe HTN, SOB as yet unexplained, N\/V, hyperglycemia).\n3. BP control: Labetolol to maintain BP less than 200 systolic; avoid large\/rapid shifts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure. Would allow some degree of hypertension (max 200 SBP) until stroke protocol MRI\/MRA obtained.\n4. Glycemic control-need to clarify home insulin regimen\n5. Resend cardiac markers in setting of tachycardia to 150s\n6. F\/u PE protocol CT (done in ED).\n7. Patient will be followed by the Neurology consult service.\n\nThis case was discussed with Dr. James Rosado MD, senior Neurology resident.\n\n\n\nAlex Waters, MD\nResident in Neurology\nPager #45445\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2096-02-22\n\n\nRE: TRENT, SHIRLEY LCC #99210914 02\/22\/2096\nXitlalic Pearson, M.D. Martha Washington Hospital 617 Comanche Street Milbank, MN 49757\nDear Dr. Pearson:\nI had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Shirley Trent in follow up this morning. Mrs. Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman with a history of a left corona radiata stroke in December 2094 complicated by a dense right hemiparesis. She presented today with her granddaughter, Ms. Carey Trent. Ms. Trent translated and provided supplemental interval history.\nInterval History Mrs. Trent moved to the Eddie Bauer Nursing home approximately one month ago. She has continued to have a dense paresis of the right arm and leg, which has confined her to a wheelchair. She has had spasticity, in particular of the right leg, that has been painful at times and has contributed to sleeping difficulties. Baclofen was initiated and titrated to 20 mg TID, with some efficacy. According to Carey, another medication may have been used around the turn of the year. Gabapentin was initiated at a dose of 100 mg HS on 2\/10\/96.\nMrs. Trent related that she has had a depressed mood in recent months. A son with whom she was close died in August of last year from complications following an admission to the hospital with asthma. This was extremely difficult for Mrs. Trent. She has felt alone, but has enjoyed visits to the nursing home from Carey and from Carey's aunt, one of Mrs. Trent's daughters. Her other children have not maintained close contact.\nMrs. Trent had increased weakness and slurring of her speech in early February, which may have been related to a urinary tract infection or sedating medication used at that time. Aside from that episode, Mrs. Trent reported no episodes of weakness, numbness, clumsiness, visual changes, slurred speech, dizziness, language difficulties, or other neurological symptoms concerning for stroke since her stroke in December 2094.\nPast Medical History type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin h\/o peptic ulcer disease with GI bleeding hyperlipidemia peripheral arterial disease, bypass surgery on the right leg, mild symptoms of claudication on the left left internal carotid artery stenosis\nMedications (confirmed) Baclofen 20 MG (10MG TABLET take 2) PO TID Clopidogrel 75 MG (75MG TABLET take 1) PO QD Gabapentin 100 MG (100MG CAPSULE take 1) PO QHS Metoclopramide HCL 10 MG (10MG TABLET take 1) PO AC Mirtazapine 30 MG (30MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS Multivitamin WITH FOLIC ACID (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 TAB PO QD x 60 days Novolog (INSULIN ASPART) SC QAM, QPM and SS Omeprazole 20 MG (20MG CAPSULE DR take 1) PO QD Toprol XL (METOPROLOL SUCCINATE EXTENDED RELEASE) 100 MG (100MG TAB.SR 24H take 1) PO QD\nAllergies NKA\nSocial History Mrs. Trent is originally from Suriname. She is widowed, with six living children. A son died at age 42 in August, 2095. Mrs. Trent has a remote history of smoking. She does not consume alcohol. She has recently spent much of her time watching television (like soap operas in Dutch) and participating in group activities (such as Bingo) at the home.\nReview of Systems Negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, visual changes, weakness, numbness, burning pain, paresthesias, difficulties speaking or understanding others, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain or burning on urination. Positive for frequent nighttime awakening. Appetite has been o.k.\nExam Blood Pressure 128\/58 Heart Rate 76 Neck: no carotid bruits Lungs: CTA bilaterally Heart: regular rate and rhythm, II\/VI systolic ejection murmur ABD: soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds present EXT: no edema MS: alert, pleasant, cooperative, good eye contact. Fatigued, mildly depressed looking affect. Oriented to LCC in Galena, March 2095. Speech fluent in Dutch. Followed 2-step verbal commands with left hand. Recalled recent events from soap opera episodes in detail. CN: pupils 4mm, round, LR to 2mm. EOMI. Mild right UMN facial weakness. Palate elevation symmetrical and tongue protrusion midline. MOTOR: increased tone with clasp knife phenomenon right arm and leg. Minimal movement of right arm (elbow flexion, index finger extension, finger flexion) and right foot (knee flexion, ankle flexion, toe extension). 5\/5 strength in proximal and distal muscles of the left arm and leg. SENSORY: reduced sensation to temperature and vibration right arm and leg relative to the left. DTRs: 3 in the right biceps, BR, triceps, 2 on the left. Trace patellar and ankle reflexes bilaterally. Right plantar response extensor, left flexor. CEREB: no dysmetria left finger nose finger.\nMRI brain 12\/10\/94: small-to-medium sized stroke in the left corona radiata\nCTA head and neck 12\/11\/94: dense calcification at the carotid bifurcation, precluding a legitimate interpretation.\nCNIS 12\/14\/94: demonstrated 25 to 49% stenosis in the proximal left ICA; velocity of 143 in the proximal ICA versus 50 in the distal CCA suggests a possible moderate (50-70%) stenosis of the vessel\nEchocardiogram (transthoracic) 12\/14\/94: estimated EF of 55 to 60%, no regional wall motion abnormalities, mild left atrial enlargement, and no other significant abnormalities.\nImpression Mrs. Shirley Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman who had a stroke in the left corona radiata in December 2094. Her stroke risk factors include history of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, and left carotid stenosis with a calcified plaque. She has not had any clinical events suggestive of stroke in the interim between 11\/94 and now. Mrs. Trent's current neurological and psychiatric problems include spasticity of the right arm and leg and depression.\nPlan 1. We will obtain repeat carotid studies to assess for interval progression of the left carotid stenosis. 2. We recommend continued management of vascular risk factors, with (1) target BP 120\/80 or less, (2) target LDL < 100, (3) continued glycemic control. Continue clopidogrel as an antiplatelet agent. 3. Regarding the spasticity, it is reasonable to utilize a higher evening dose of gabapentin and assess the efficacy. Other potential agents to consider for future use include cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, and trihexyphenidyl. I will continue to follow and would be happy to discuss this management with you at any time. 4. I agree with mirtazapine for antidepressant therapy given Mrs. Trent's poor appetite and impaired sleep. After her gabapentin has been appropriately titrated, one may consider increasing mirtazapine to 45 mg HS. 5. Mrs. Trent will be scheduled for follow up in approximately 6 months.\nIt is a pleasure to participate in the care of Mrs. Trent with you. Greater than 50% of this 60 minute follow up visit was spent counseling regarding the above issues. Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.\nSincerely,\nJames Rosado, M.D. Neurology Lenox Care Center\n\ncc: Ms. Carey Trent 45 Hoyts Lane, Qpt. 0 Galena, MN 64864\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2091-12-28\nDecember 28, 2091\n\n\n\nNikkolas Nancy-Jasmine\n693-31-18-1\n\nI saw Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine today for evaluation concerning his stroke in August 2091. The information available today is limited to his knowledge of the events.\n\nHe is an 67-year-old Honduran man with a history of diabetes mellitus and HTN. In August he suffered a stroke. He reports that his speech was affected and that he developed severe right arm and leg weakness without sensory loss. He recalls no problem with his vision. He was hospitalized at Dubuque Obstetrics Gynocology Center. He does no know the extent of the evaluation. He was discharged on aspirin to Mitchell County Hospital. He is now living at home with his wife and son with visiting nurse assistance. His primary care physician is at Flagler Hospital. He has severe residual weakness of the right arm and leg. He also complains of dizziness and an abnormal numbness in his mouth. The dizziness is worst in the morning. He also notices a noise in his head when he sleeps.\n\nHe has DM and HTN. He is a nonsmoker. I don't have cholesterol information. There is no history of cardiac disease. There is no history of alcohol abuse.\n\nHe is currently taking aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive medication of some type and possibly a cholesterol lowering agent, although he is no sure of this. He has no known allergies.\n\nHe is aware of no significant family history.\n\nHe is married. He lives with his wife and 22-year-old son. He came to america from Honduras in 2073. He worked nights in construction until his stroke.\n\nPulse 66, regular. BP 186\/110. There are no cranial bruits. The carotid pulses are full with no bruits. The lungs are clear. The heart is regular with no murmur. The abdomen is benign. The mental state is normal; he speaks Spanish and broken English. He is able to name, repeat, and comprehend well. His fluency in his native language is probably normal. Cranial nerves are intact. There is severe weakness of the right arm and leg: right interossei and finger flexors 1\/5, finger extensors 0\/5, biceps 1\/5, triceps 0-1\/5, deltoid 0-1\/5. (He tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.) Right iliopsoas 2\/5, quadriceps 2\/5, hamstrings 1\/5, distally 0\/5. The tone is only mildly increased. Sensation is intact. Reflexes are slghtly brisker in the right upper extremity (RUE 2+\/4, LUE 2\/4, knees 2+\/4, ankles 2\/4). The right plantar response is mute; he withdraws the left. Coordination is intact; weakness inhibits adequate testing on the right. He wears a right AFO. He can stand up from his wheelchair and bear weight maneuvering himself to the examining table, but he cannot walk unsupported.\n\nHis examination is most consistent with a right equal arm and leg pure motor hemiparesis, sparing the face. This was likely due to a lacunar infarction in the left basis pontis from small vessel occlusion. He has major stroke risk factors, including DM, HTN, and probably hypercholesterolemia. Currently his major needs are to establish good control of his blood pressure and to control other risk factors, including optimtal glucose control and likely medication for hyperlipidemia, and to continue physical and occupational therapy to maximize his functional status.\n\nTo review the studies that were done to investigate his stroke in August, I will request the record of that hospitalization from DOGC. I will also request his records from his physician at the Flagler Hospital. He will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen. He tells me that he is planning to see his PCP for this purpose. I asked him to return here in a month to review this.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nPatrick Winn, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2092-05-24\n\nBAYONNE MEDICAL CENTER Internal Medicine 15 Hassell Brook Road Daytona Highridge Estates, AZ 39757\nNancy-Jasmine, Nikkolas 69331181 05\/24\/92\nThe patient is a 67-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes, and history of recent stroke who comes in for follow up and for evaluation of positive PPD.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: He was being evaluated for day program and in the course of this had a PPD placed which was positive.

He had a L thalamocapsular infarct in 8\/2091 with R residual hemiparesis, and a R thalamocapsular infarct 5\/93 with subsequent residual dysarthria. During his May hospitalization he had dysphagia for which he briefly received tube feeds before graduating to POs. He went to Honduras approximately 3 months ago, and ran out of many of his medications in the last 2 weeks, including plavix, lopressor, and metformin. He self-d\/c'd zestril for new nausea that he felt was related. Since symptom onset 7 days ago, patient has noted slow improvement in both dysarthria and dysphagia. He continues to note vertigo present sitting, worse standing, and absent supine. He has had difficulty ambulating as well, despite the use of his tripod cane, and his children have helped him at home. He returned from Honduras 3 days ago to refill his medications and get his symptoms evaluated. ROS notable for poor vision bilaterally, worse on the L per patient.

When pressed, she notes that about 6 months ago, she had an episode of mild chest tightness while at rest which was not particularly severe nor was it exacerbated or relieved by any measures. These sx occurred only once, and lasted for a few hours before abating. She reports that she thought it might be heartburn, though she is not prone to dyspepsia. Subsequently, she denies any exertional dyspnea, CP, jaw or arm pain, belching, post-prandial discomfort, heartburn or palpitations. She has not had any sx of CHF including pnd, orthopnea or LE edema. Moreover, she denies claudication (legs or arms). She reports that she has a sedentary lifestyle, but still carries groceries, does laundry, and usual housework without limitation. She presented to her PCP Dr. Ong for an annual physical recently and on ECG, he noted new inferior Q waves and referred her for ETT which she had today. As noted below, she had an early positive ECG with NO symptoms of angina, but with marked light-headedness with STD and bigeminy lasting up to 20' into recovery. Scans were notable for EF 51% with inferior HK and an inferior fixed defect and inferolateral ischemia.

I have discussed the rationale, risks and benefits of diagnostic angiography, and she understands and is willing to proceed. She understands that revascularization decisions will be dynamic and may include PCI or CABG (or medical rx). She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.\n1) CAD: ASA 325mg daily, Statins to LDL<70mg\/dL, Low dose BB for now along with ACEI to R arm BP of 140s\/80s for now. NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+\/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis. Will discuss with Drs. Harper\/Kumar tomorrow. Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio\/gradient, LVG. She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc) 2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this. She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed. 3) Secondary prevention as above 4) DM: Will need medical rx on d\/c.

He had known calcific AS and presented with increasing fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. He was subsequently found to have worsening AS and CAD, including LM disease. His peri-operative course has been notable for hyperglycemia with maximum BG 252. He was started on an insulin infusion according to the Portland Protocol and remains on 0.5-2 units\/hour since midnight with BS 117-134-163-151-125-137-98-99.\n\nMr. Ervin recalls having been diagnosed with DM at the age of 19 as part of a military physical. He was overweight and was placed on dietary therapy. Per his own report his DM was diet controlled and seemed to disappear several years after initial diagnosis. Approximately 4 years ago he experienced blurry vision and was again noted to have elevated BGs (he is uncertain of the magnitude of the BG elevation). He resumed dietary therapy and has achieved good control with a pre-op A1c of 6.2. He is followed at the Skiff. He has never been on insulin or OHAs and denies knowledge of diabetic complications. He checks BS at home sporadically which are usually in the low-mid 100s. He says when he experiences hyperglycemic symptoms (i.e. occasional nocturia) he walks to bring down his blood sugar. In general he is active, walking several miles\/day.\n\nPast Medical History: HTN, AS, DM2 as above\n\nCurrent Medications: Insulin, K\/Mg, ASA, Toradol, Zofran, Vanco, Carafate\n\nSocial History: remote tobacco, ETOH\n\nFamiy History: Son with DM1, Grandmother with DM\n\nROS: Denies HA or changes in vision. +SOB PTA.

Meticulous BG control is important in the post-operative period. The goal is to maintain BS<175. He should remain on the Portland Protocol until at least POD #3. At that point only if he is fully stabilized and eating well can he be transitioned on to an alternative regimen. He may transiently require subcutaneous insulin but will ideally be able to resume dietary control of DM.\n\nThank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.

I also interviewed and examined the patient.\nPlease see the note for more details.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 71-year-old gentleman with\na history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and 2\nweeks of intermittent chest pain for which he was evaluated with\nstress test a week prior to ED visit, which was abnormal. The\npatient had a plan for cardiac catheterization the day after this\nED visit but presented on this day for an episode of chest\ndiscomfort which occurred at rest, which was unlike his previous\nepisodes of chest discomfort which usually occurred with\nactivity. He took nitroglycerin with relief and then presented\nfor further evaluation and treatment.\nMEDICATIONS: Metformin, Toprol, Cozaar, nitro, aspirin, and\nAltace.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is awake and alert, in no distress,\nchest pain free. Afebrile with pulse 72, blood pressure 129\/69,\nand O2 saturation 98% on room air. His lungs are clear to\nauscultation. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen is soft\nand nontender. Extremities are warm and well perfused. No\nelevated JVP.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: An EKG was done revealing right\nbundle-branch block, but sinus rhythm at 67 with no ischemic\nchanges. IV access was established. Labs were sent revealing\nessentially normal CBC and electrolytes. Initial troponin was\nless than assay with an INR of 1.1 and chest x-ray, which was\nnormal. The patient has been taking aspirin prior to arrival.\nHeart rate was in the 60s in the emergency room and no additional\nbeta-blockade was given to the patient. However, based on his\nstory, which was suggestive for unstable angina, he was given\nLovenox in the emergency room. I spoke to the Cardiology B\nattending on call who agreed to take the patient on to his\nservice for probable cardiac catheterization in the near future.\nWith this plan, he was admitted in stable condition with a\ndiagnosis of unstable angina.\nCRITICAL CARE TIME: 50 minutes.\n\nYERGER, DESEAN MD\nD: 08\/01\/60\nT: 08\/01\/60\nDictated By: YERGER, DESEAN\neScription document:0-0255081 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2060-07-28\n\nGIPSON, ALEC 32707420 07\/28\/2060\nVernon Lozano, M.D. CV Division, Ireton Medical Clinic 91 Neptune Lane Abilene, FL 81494\nDear Vernon,\nI write to summarize for your records the recent IMC course of your patient, Dr. Alec Gipson, who was admitted to our cardiology service on 07\/25\/2060 with progressive angina and a small, non-ST elevation MI. His cardiac troponin rose to 0.13. There were no demonstrable ECG changes, though we queried the possibility of a left circumflex event. He had been previously scheduled for semi-urgent catheterization and angiography on 07\/26\/2060.\nHis condition stabilized with institution of anti-thrombotic and anti-ischemic therapy. He was taken to the catheterization laboratory by Dr. Otero on 07\/26\/2060. Angiography demonstrated a high-grade lesion in the proximal portion of a large first diagonal branch, as well as a significant stenosis in the first obtuse marginal branch. The diagonal lesion was managed with angioplasty and deployment of a drug-eluting stent. A drug-eluting stent could not be delivered to the obtuse marginal lesion; a bare-metal stent was positioned without difficulty. He did have smoldering chest discomfort of an anginal nature following the procedure. The cardiac troponin elevated further to a peak value of 0.86 as of 07\/27\/2060 (08:54). He also had a mild, vagal reaction characterized by flushing and transient bradycardia.\nHe felt much improved the following day. A repeat cardiac troponin returned at a lower level of 0.75. An abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of an AAA. After consultation with you, we felt that he could return home, under the care of his wife.\nHe was discharged on the afternoon of 07\/27\/2060. His medications included Ecotrin 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, losartan 100 mg daily, metformin 500 mg b.i.d, Toprol-XL 50 mg b.i.d, niacin 500 mg b.i.d, ramipril 2.5 mg daily, and nitroglycerin if needed.\nPlease let me know if I can provide you with any further information.\nSincerely yours,\nVictor Quijano, M.D.\n\n\neScription document:6-5332849 DFFocus\n\nDD: 07\/28\/60 DT: 07\/29\/60 DV: 07\/28\/60\n\n* Record date: 2061-01-31\nEDVISIT^32707420^GIPSON, ALEXANDER^01\/31\/61^VELASQUEZ, WALTER\nThis patient was seen by myself and Dr. Hardin on 01\/31\/2061. I\nconfirm I interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the\nresident's documentation, and discussed the plan of care with the\npatient.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 73-year-old gentleman who\nhas a history of CAD status post stent in 2060, who developed\nacute chest discomfort, pressure like, diaphoresis, and weakness,\nwhile he was working as a chiropractor. He says although this\nwas quite significant, it was not like his prior MI discomfort.\nHe denies any radiation to his back or his arm. He denies any\njaw pain. He denies any fever, chills, or sweats. He denies any\nvomiting. He denies any headache or neck pain. He denies any\nbowel or bladder changes and no lower extremity edema. He is\ntaking his medicines. He also took an aspirin, did get some\nnitroglycerin.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes, hypertension,\nhypercholesterolemia, and CAD.\nMEDICATIONS: Cozaar, aspirin, Altace, metformin, and Toprol.\nALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He is a past smoker, not a drinker or drug user.\nHe lives with his family.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As noted in the HPI, otherwise negative.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is in no acute distress at rest. He\nsays his chest pain is essentially gone on oxygen. Vital signs\nare as noted. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat: Normocephalic\nand atraumatic. Pupils are equal and reactive to light.\nExtraocular motions are intact. Oropharynx is unremarkable.\nNeck is supple. There is no jugular venous distention. Chest is\nclear to auscultation. Heart is regular rate and rhythm. His\nabdomen is soft and nontender. There is no hepatosplenomegaly.\nThere are no masses. His skin is warm and dry. There is no\nlower extremity edema. He has equal pulses. His neuro exam is\nalert and oriented to person, place, and time. His cranial\nnerves are intact. He is grossly nonfocal.\nLABORATORY DATA: He has a white count of 8, hematocrit of 46,\nand platelet count of 200,000. His SMA-7 is unremarkable. CK-MB\nand troponin are flat and INR is 1. His EKG shows less than 1 mm\nST depressions in V2, without any reciprocal or other changes.\nASSESSMENT: The patient with a history of CAD with concerning\nsymptoms. He did have a fight earlier in the day, although was\nnot under significant stress at the time of this event. Given\nhis prior CAD history, the patient was given Lopressor. Decision\nwas made to admit him for rule out acute coronary syndrome. The\npatient was admitted in stable condition. The patient had\nalready got an aspirin and the patient remained in stable\ncondition until he was admitted.\nDIAGNOSIS: Rule out acute coronary syndrome.\n\nVELASQUEZ, WALTER M.D.\nD: 01\/31\/61\nT: 02\/01\/61\nDictated By: VELASQUEZ, WALTER\neScription document:9-1137686 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2063-01-17\n\n\n\nGIPSON, ALEXANDER 32707420 01\/17\/2063\n\nUlysses Peralta, M.D. 82 March Street Coalinga, FL 84635\nDear Dr. Peralta:\nI saw your patient, Dr. Gipson, in the Cardiology Office today on a somewhat urgent basis. He was recently in Italy last week with very difficult events concerning his father's ill health. His father ultimately died and was a very traumatic series of days for Dr. Gipson and his family. He developed left chest discomfort, which persisted for a number of days. He was afraid to take nitroglycerin despite knowing that he should, and therefore remained with chest discomfort for about six days. He was able to be reasonably active and had no exacerbation of his chest discomfort. He had no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or palpitations. He then returned to the United States and his symptoms have resolved. Because of these discomforts, he wanted to undergo an additional evaluation.\nWe performed an exercise treadmill test with perfusion imaging two days ago for better understanding of his symptoms. He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol to a peak heart rate of 122 beats per minute (84% of maximum predicted for age) and peak blood pressure of 162\/80. He stopped because of dyspnea and had some discomfort. The discomfort resolved into recovery. He had no ST segment changes. His perfusion scan demonstrated normal LV size and normal tracer uptake in the lungs. There was normal RV size as well. There was a small-to-medium medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior wall that was reversible. These were no different than the prior study he had in July 2061.\nAs you may remember, in January 2061, he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated the presence of non-major flow-limiting obstructions and so no intervention was performed.\nHis current medical regimen includes ramipril 5 mg b.i.d, aspirin 162 mg daily, Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d, Crestor 10 mg daily, fish oil 500 mg b.i.d, metformin 500 mg b.i.d, multivitamins, niacin 500 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Toprol-XL 100 mg b.i.d, HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and Nexium.\nOn exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 135\/75, a heart rate of 60 and regular, and weight of 189 pounds. Head and neck are unremarkable. Chest is clear. Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees. PMI is normal. S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split. There is an S4 and 1\/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border. Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly. Bowel sounds are normal. The extremities show no edema or cyanosis. Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit. Distal pulses are normal.\nHis resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm and normal morphology.\nI think Dr. Gipson is basically doing very well. I think his chest discomforts for six days while in Italy may be related to anxiety and perhaps the known gastroesophageal reflux disease that he has. I think there is no evidence that the discomfort was cardiac in origin. His exercise capacity is quite good and his perfusion is actually somewhat even improved from his prior evaluation two years ago. I think we can maintain our current approach. I suggest that I see him in a number of months for future evaluation.\nIf any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.\nKindest regards.\nSincerely yours,\n\nVernon A Lozano, MD\n\n\n\n\neScription document:9-1764070 IFFocus\n\n\nDD: 01\/17\/63 DT: 01\/18\/63 DV: 01\/17\/63\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2069-11-01\nPatient Name: HORNE,MILTON [ MRN: 2177024GMH ]\nDate of Visit: 11\/01\/2069\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Data and Overall Health\n56 yo male\n\nChief Complaint\nThe patient is scheduled for excision of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of lower lip on 11\/11\/69.\n\nHistory of Present Illness\nThe patient complains of lower lip lesion since 7\/69.\n\nPast Surgical History\nPrior surgery includes:\ntosillectomy\nno anesthetic complications\n\nFamily History\nThere in no family history of adverse reactions to general anesthesia.\n\nPast Medical History\nCurrent medical problems include:\nBPH\nnasal polyps\nGERD\numbilical hernia\n\nSocial History\nSmoking: quit 30 yrs ago, exposed to significant 2nd hand smoke\nAlcohol use: no history of excessive use\nSubstance abuse: none\n\nReview of Systems\nMedications:\nflomax\nprilosec\nvancenase\nAllergies: none\nCardiovascular: no history of hypertension, no MI; denies CP, +DOE, no syncope, no ankle edema.

As you know, he is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary disease, admitted to GMH in June 2077 after a non-ST-elevation MI, and had a bare-metal stent placed in his LAD. He has done well since that procedure. He denies any exertional chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea, pedal edema, lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.\nMedications: Aspirin 325 mg daily. Atorvastatin 80 mg daily. Metoprolol 100 mg daily. Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily. Plavix 75 mg daily. Nexium 40 mg daily.\nPast medical history: Significant for, Benign prostatic hypertrophy. Basal cell carcinoma. Gastroesophageal reflux. Umbilical hernia. Hypertension. Hyperlipidemia. Coronary artery disease.\nFamily history: Significant for brother had an MI at age 68. Father who had MIs in his 60s and a coronary artery bypass grafting. Mother never had coronary disease.\nSocial history: He is single. Never married. No children. He never smoked. He drinks one to two drinks a week. He denies illicit drugs. He also works as a Recruitment Officer.\nPhysical examination: -Pulse: 60 and regular -BP: 110\/60 -resp. rate: 16 and unlabored -General: He is a well-developed, well-nourished white male in no acute distress. Alert and cooperative. Oriented x 3 -Heent: No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag. Mucous membranes are moist. Trachea is midline -Neck: Thyroid is nonpalpable. Carotids are 2+ without bruits. JVP is less than 7 cm of water -Chest: Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes -Cardiac: Normal S1 and S2, a grade 1\/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border -Abdomen: Normal bowel sounds. No organomegaly -Extremities: Peripheral pulses are 1+ and symmetric. He has no pedal edema. He has no clubbing or cyanosis\nSelected recent labs:\nLast cholesterol was, 07\/06\/2077, showed total cholesterol 174, triglycerides 111, HDL 44, and LDL 108.\nOther Data: The patient underwent exercise tolerance testing in August 2077 and was able to exercise for 6 minutes. He had no chest pain. Nuclear images showed no evidence of ischemia or previous infarct. LV function was normal. EKG today shows normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, right bundle-branch block, and an old IMI.\nAssessment and plan: In summary, this is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who had an MI in June 2077, which was a non-ST-elevation MI. He underwent stenting of his LAD. Since that time, he has not had any exertional angina. He has no evidence of fluid retention or decompensated congestive heart failure. Blood pressure is fine today. Cholesterol is not perfect, but acceptable. He is on a high dose of atorvastatin. He is on a good medical regimen and at this point, I would keep him on his current medicines and plan to see him back in another six months. He would like to enter a Cardiac Rehab Program and I think that certainly is a reasonable thing to do.\nAs always, it is a pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentleman.\nBest personal regards,\nSincerely yours,\n\n\nDominic Issa MD,PhD\nSigned electronically by Dominic Issa, MD,PhD Document Status: Final\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2092-08-30\n\n\nNAME: Yager, Becky\nMRN: 0887181\n\nBecka returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy. She showed me a foot ulcer\nthat she has had since early August. In fact, this was debrided on August 9 by Dr.\nNoyes and was found to contain Staph aureus sensitive to oxacillin and Bactrim.\nShe was treated with Augmentin for 2 weeks with little improvement. She has not\nhad any fever. She continues on her chronic pain medications and Percocet.\n\nOn exam, the second toe on the right foot is severely swollen and red. There is an\nulcer which looks quite deep on the medial aspect of the toe. I had Dr. Drew\ntake a look at her foot who agreed that she should be seen in the emergency room.\n\nIMPRESSION: Cellulitis\/right toe ulcer - Persistent infection and unresponsiveness\nto 2-week course of Augmentin raise concern of underlying osteomyelitis. Rebecca\nwas referred into the emergency room for further evaluation. She also was given a\nnew prescription for her Percocet #100. I will see her in follow-up in 1 month.\n\nRowena Xanders, M.D.\n\nRX\/mcbride\/richardson\n\ncc: Georgia Xing, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2092-12-27\n\n\nNAME: Yager, Rebecca\nMRN: 0887181\n\nFOLLOW-UP VISIT\n\nPatient returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.\n\nSince last seen, her Dilantin level came back at 18.8. She feels her pain has been\nunder relatively good control. She has had a few falls since she was last seen all\ndue to losing her balance or tripping. No lightheadedness or vertigo preceding her\nfalls. She is trying to be more careful to avoid future falls by watching closely\nwhere she is walking.\n\nShe has no active infection at present. She is scheduled for follow-up EMG nerve\nconduction studies in January.\n\nON EXAM: She is her usual pleasant self. Examination of the feet shows\nhammertoes, numerous bunions, some reddened calluses but no ulcers or open\nlesions. There is vibratory loss to the ankles and absent ankle jerks bilaterally.\n\nIMPRESSION: Painful neuropathy with 10-year history of progressive symptoms.\nNumerous previous work-ups for reversible causes of neuropathy have been\nnegative. I would like to have her be evaluated by Dr. Phyllis Brewer of\nInternal Medicine to see if she has any other ideas as to any additional work-up\nor treatment. Of note, previously had a DENA panel for sensory neuropathy\nwhich was negative. Rebecca was given a new prescription for Percocet #100. I will\nsee her in follow-up in two months.\n\n\n\nRowena Xanders, M. D.\nRX\/mcbride\/xiang\n\n* Record date: 2094-04-03\n\nNAME: Yager, Becky MRN: 0887181\nBecky returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy. A lot has happened since she was seen. She was terminated at her job working as a Credit Manager in December 2093. She therefore has been having financial problems. She does not have enough money to buy her medications. She has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. She has not taken these medications for months. She states she has been taking her nortriptyline, dilantin and Percocet as previously prescribed. When I called her from the waiting room today, she walked towards me, she veered, and I caught her before she fell. We then got the wheelchair and wheeled her into the room and history was taken. She reports being off balance for about the past month. She has been feeling more unsteady on her feet. She states she has not actually fallen but has come close to falling. She denies any true vertigo, ringing in her ears, headaches, change in mentation, numbness, weakness or change in gait. On review of other systems, she reports a 20 lb. weight gain over the past few months which she attributes to not working and being at home and eating more than usual. She also notes that she has begun urinating at night which she previously did not do. She complains of excessive dry mouth. She reports being more thirsty than usual.\nPHYSICAL EXAM: On exam, she was her usual pleasant self. She is alert and oriented X 3. Speech fluent without aphasia. BP sitting 145\/70. Pulse 80. Standing BP unchanged at 145\/70. Pulse 80. Cranial nerve exam notable for prominent bilateral nystagmus. Otherwise intact. On motor exam, no tremor or involuntary movements. No drift. Good power throughout. Fine finger movements intact. Vibratory loss to the ankles. Babinski flexor bilaterally.\nWhen she got up to stand at the end of the evaluation to leave and telling me she was fine, she veered to the right and I again caught her.\nIMPRESSION: Imbalance with history of recently running out of many of her medications though taking her chronic pain medications as previously prescribed. Also notable in the history is new nocturia, increased thirst and dry mouth. Her exam is notable for prominent end-gaze nystagmus. Therefore I suspect toxic metabolic cause. As she will need STAT lytes, blood sugar, dilantin level and tox screen as well as cardiac evaluation, the patient was referred to PROMPTCARE ER. I will be in touch with the physicians after they see her.\nRowena Xanders, M.D.\nRX\/mcbride\/tucker\ncc: Georgia Xing, M.D.\n\n* Record date: 2096-04-11\n\nInternal Medicine Intern Admission Note\n\nPatient Name: REBECCA YAGER\nMR#: 0887181\nDate of Admission: 4\/11\/96\nAttending: Dr. Georgia Xing\nIntern: Branden Ocasio\n\nID\/CC: There's a herd of elephants on my chest.\n\nHPI: 69 yo F with PMH of DM, HTN, s\/p MI one year ago, now presents with substernal chest pain and increased shortness of breath x 2 days. Patient was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began experiencing unremitting substernal chest pain, nonradiating. This pain was constant, 24 hours\/day, and felt like a herd of elephants on my chest. This was accompanied by an increased shortness of breath, especially with exertion, which the patient had not experienced before. The chest pain and shortness of breath would wake her up at night, accompanied by drenching sweats and a dizziness, I felt like I was about to faint. Patient sleeps with two pillows at baseline. The pain eventually grew to be so severe that the patient called EMS. Upon their arrival at her house she was given 2 doses of SL nitro which improved her pain.\n\nIn the TPG ED her vital signs were Temp AF, HR 70, BP 154\/79, RR 20, satting 99% RA. EKG showed a new Twave inversion in V3, otherwise at her baseline normal EKG. IV heparin was started for possible MI given her symptoms and history. D-dimer was elevated at 782. Based on these findings and her shortness of breath, PE-CT was obtained, which was negative for PE. However, it did show multiple new mediastinal lymph nodes up to 9mm in size, as well as a 6mm nodule in the LLL. The patient was given ASA, MSO4, nitro, and made chest pain free in the ED. She was admitted for continued rule out for MI and workup of her pulmonary findings.\n\nROS: No fevers\/chills. Does report cough, cold sores x 1 week. The patient did report having slight lower quadrant abdominal pain, with some nausea but no vomiting, No hematochezia\/melena. No increased frequency, no dysuria.

There are several mediastinal lymph\nnodes measuring slightly less than 1 cm in size. However, in the\nregion of the AP window there are numerous AP window lymph nodes\nmeasuring approximately 9 mm in short axis. These could be\nreactive or neoplastic. There is a less than 1 cm left hilar\nnode. In the posterior left lower lobe there is a 6 mm\nparenchymal nodule. This is best demonstrated on image 65. This\ncould possibly represent a malignancy. Alternatively this could\nrepresent an intraparenchymal lymph node. This does not appear to\ntouch the pleural surface and rounded atelectasis would seem less\nlikely. Some scarring and volume loss is noted in the medial\nright lung base. There is no pneumothorax. No significant\npleural fluid is noted. There is no pericardial fluid.\nIMPRESSION:\nNo pulmonary embolism or DVT. There are multiple mediastinal\nlymph nodes as well as a 6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe.\nNeoplasm cannot be excluded. A follow-up chest CT may be further\nvalue. These findings were discussed with Dr. Hendricks at the time\nof dictation.\n\nEKG: NSR, compared to prior there is new flipped T wave in III, however no ST\/T wave abnormalities, no evidence of infarction.\n\nA\/P:\nPt is a 69 yo F with PMH notable for DM, HTN, peripheral neuropathy and s\/p MI with multiple admissions for rule out, who presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, nightsweats, dizziness, and new mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a lung nodule not noted on prior chest X-rays. This constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways: from a cardiac standpoint, as presentation of unstable angina, given her hx of MI and cardiac risk factors; from an oncological standpoint, as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome, given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness, abd pain\/nausea, chest pain and dyspnea, and the findings in Ab CT and Chest CT, or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking; from an infectious disease standpoint, as possible reactivation tuberculosis, given that she has a history of TB infection and treatment. I believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies, given that she appears to be ruling out for an MI, has little to no ischemic changes on EKG, and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating. Workup should proceed in the direction of ruling out TB, and establishing the nature of the pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\n\nCV:\n--Rate: well controlled without medication.\n--Rhythm: normal sinus\n--Pump: On ACEI, HCTZ for HTN.\n--ischemia: on ASA\/statin.

Mr. Jay was seen in the ED the day prior to admission with the same complaint of new onset LLQ pain, which was sharp, non radiating, and most painful with inspiration. He reports that at this time, he has some mild shortness of breath with the onset of the pain, although this was resolved by the time he was seen in the ED. He did not complain of any chest pain, palpitations or dipahoresis at that time, although he did have some nausea and vomited once in the ED. Patient is well known to the ED from prior admissions, and at that time his pain was felt to be 2\/2 to throacic radiculopathy\/neuropathy 2\/2 to his diabetes, however acuity of pain, CT abdomen was performed at that time, which did not reveal any acute patholgy to explain his pain. He was discharged to home at that time with oral pain medication. Patient reports that pain did not improve, and was not well controlled with oral pain mediations at home, so he re- presented to the ED. He does not report any fevers or chills, shortness of breath, cough, back pain, or LE swelling. Patient is anuric and has been attending dialysis per his usual MWF routine.\nOn presentation to the ED, patient was afebrile, BP 180s\/90s, HR 70s, satting 100% on RA. He was given IV morphine for his pain, and IV benedryl for nausea (he has had a cyclic vomiting\/nausea syndrome on prior admission which has been effectively treated this way). Patient reported at that time that he had not had a bowel movement in 3 days, and that he normally has one every other day. Rectal exam did not reveal any stool in the vault, and CT scan from the day prior did not show excessive stool or evidence of obstruction or fecal impaction. However, patient was given dulcolax PR. He was admitted to medicine for further evaluation and pain control.\n\nPMH:\nIDDM, diagnosed 20 years ago, complicated by retinopathy 5 years ago, nephropathy 5 years ago, and bilateral TMA 8 years ago ESRD on HD, started HD 5 years ago, on MWF schedule at Cochran Memorial Hospital\nBilateral blindness for 5 years 2\/2 diabetic retinopathy\nHypertension\nHyperlipidemia\nDepressionGERD\/Gastritis\nS\/p bilateral TMA 8 years ago, complicated by osteomyelitis of right foot in 2065 and 2068\n\nS\/p cholecystectomy\n\nAllergies:\nNKDA\n\nHome medications:\nAcetylsalicylic Acid 81 MG (81 MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD #100 Tablet(s) Amlodipine 10 MG (10 MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD x 30 days #30 Tablet(s) Cinacalcet 30 MG PO QHS #30 Tablet(s) Clonidine 0.2 MG PO BID Cymbalta (DULOXETINE) 20 MG (20MG CAPSULE DR Take 1) PO BID #60 Capsule(s) Diphenhydramine Oral 25 MG PO 3x\/Week M-W-F PRN Itching, originally prescribed MWF with dialysis, has been taking TID with meals Docusate Sodium 100 MG PO BID #100 Capsule(s) Epoetin Alfa (NON-ONCOLOGY) 6000 UNITS IVPUSH x1 Hecterol 6 MCG IV with dialysis, With Dialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday #1 Month(s) Supply Hecterol 6 MG 3x\/Week M-W-F, GIve with HD Insulin Lispro Mix 75\/25 12 UNITS SC QPM #1 Month(s) Supply Insulin Lispro Mix 75\/25 25 UNITS SC QAM #1 Month(s) Supply Insulin Syringes ONE PO bid #1 Month(s) Supply Kexalate 15 GM PO bid, On non dialysis days - En los dias que no se hace dialisis #1 Month(s) Supply Lisinopril 40 MG PO QD, on non-dialysis days only Miralax (POLYETHYLENE Glycol) 17 GM (17G POWD PACK) PO QD PRN constipation, Each 17 GM dose to be dissolved in 8 oz of water x 15 days #15 doses Nephro-vit Rx 1 TAB PO QD #90 Tablet(s) Omeprazole 20 MG (20 MG CAPSULE DR Take 1) PO QD #90 Capsule(s) Reglan (METOCLOPRAMIDE Hcl) 5 MG (5 MG TABLET Take 1) PO AC PRN nausea, constipation x 30 days #90 Tablet(s) Sennosides 17.2 MG PO BID PRN Constipation Sevelamer 2400 MG (800MG TABLET Take 3) PO TID Simvastatin 20 MG (20MG TABLET Take 1) PO QHS #90 Tablet(s) Toprol Xl (METOPROLOL Succinate Extended Release) 150 MG (100 MG TAB.SR 24H Take 1) PO QD, Take 1 pill of 100 mg and 1 pill 50 mg for total of 150 mg #60 TAB.SR\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n\nMother and grandmother with DM.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: (per note from previous admission 3\/10\/68)\nOriginally from Panama City.

Since the surgery she has done quite well. She was in Sibley Care Center from 4\/08 to 4\/22\/69 and had undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy and also education on dietary modification. During her hospital course she had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and hypokinesis of the septal wall with mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. She was started on lisinopril to help prevent diabetic nephropathy. She also received two units of packed red blood cells at her stay at Sibley Care as it was noted that her hematocrit was only 24. She was also briefly treated with Epogen and it was felt that her renal dysfunction may have been the cause of her low hematocrit. Her renal function has improved considerably since stopping diuretics. Since going home from Sibley Care, she is starting to walk more with assistance from a physical therapist around the house. She is not experiencing any exertional chest pressure, pain or shortness of breath. She also mentions she is currently going to a Diabetes Support Group tomorrow and plans to get some psychotherapy through Northern Illinois Medical Center later next month. Medications: Her current medications are aspirin 81 mg. p.o. q.d, lisinopril, increased to 20 p.o. daily today, Coumadin 5 p.o. q.d, Kayexalate 15 p.o. q. day, albuterol metered dose inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d, Azmacort 4 puffs b.i.d, Lasix 40 p.o. q. day, Nephrocaps one tablet p.o. q. day, NPH Insulin 75 units q. a.m. and 60 units subcu q. p.m, Prilosec 20 p.o. q.d, Paxil 30 mg. p.o. q. day and CPAP 8 centimeters water plus 2 liters O2 q. h.s. Physical Examination: On physical examination her weight is 326 pounds. Her blood pressure is 150\/110, on repeat per M.D. 150\/100, pulse is 80. Her skin is without any rashes or ecchymoses, or suspicious nevi present. Heart regular rhythm, distant heart sounds with positive S1 and S2. Her lungs are clear, there is no sternal instability and the sternal wound is well healed. Her extremities are without any edema. Her O2 sat on room air is 98%. Diagnosis: 1) Coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery 4\/1\/69. 2) Chronic renal insufficiency.Chandler, Jessica MRN #748-80-38-0 May 05, 2069 Page 2 3) Diabetes mellitus. 4) Anemia of chronic disease. 5) Obstructive sleep apnea. 6) Intermittent problems with hyperkalemia. 7) Hypertension. 8) Morbid obesity. Plan: 1) Coronary artery disease status post CABG. She is clinically doing quite well without any signs of congestive heart failure or angina. Her ejection fraction significantly improved postoperatively. I am concerned about a relatively high blood pressure and the visiting nurses have reported that it has been going up into the 180s systolic with ambulation. I will increase her lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg. with a careful watch of her potassium. 2) Chronic renal insufficiency. Again we'll check regular labs once to twice weekly monitoring renal function. 3) Diabetes mellitus. Stable. Her blood pressure have been under fairly good control. She has also lost a significant amount of weight over 20 pounds. Her current weight is 326 pounds. We'll check hemoglobin A1 with next blood draw. 4) Anemia of chronic disease. We'll also recheck her blood count and follow-up. 5) Obstructive sleep apnea. The patient is using her CPAP machine at night time and I've encouraged her to do so. 6) Hyperkalemia. She will continue with the Kayexalate as prescribed and also we'll continue to monitor her potassium regularly over the next several months until they normalize. 7) Morbid obesity. She is making good progress with her weight loss. She is going to continue on an out-patient program once weekly and she is also going to be going for some mental health counseling as well which will hopefully continue her on a successful weight loss plan.Chandler, Jessica MRN #748-80-38-0 May 05, 2069 Page 3 She will follow-up with me in one month's time.

She has had no chest pain, no nausea, no vomiting. Minimal diaphoresis. She has had a fever. No urinary symptoms. She does have chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, CHF and diabetes. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above plus status post coronary artery bypass grafting. MEDICATIONS: Lasix, Prilosec, Cozaar, aspirin, Paxil, Flovent, albuterol and Nephrocaps. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: A non-smoker. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: An obese female, mild acute distress. Temperature 101 degrees. Heart has a regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Diffuse rhonchi throughout with bibasilar rales. The abdomen is obese, soft. Neurologic exam is non-focal. LABORATORY EVALUATION: Chest x-ray shows a poor inspiratory effort, no obvious infiltrate, perhaps some hazy infiltrates. EKG is unchanged. Labs: Unable to obtain at this time. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: The patient was seen and evaluated. Chest x-ray was obtained. The patient has an IV established but were unable to draw labs. Under my direct supervision and with some attempts by me, multiple attempts are made at the infraclavicular and supraclavicular left and right subclavian vein without success. The groins bilateral have damp, moist exudate and the neck anatomy is difficult to assess. We are unable to establish a line. She has a chest x-ray for rule out of pneumothorax or hemothorax and she will need an arterial stick for blood draws. IMPRESSION: Hypoxia, possible pneumonia and a facial abscess. PLAN: Admission. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): Condition on admission is stable.

I had added Zaroxolyn on to her regimen which she is tolerating well. However, her recent laboratory studies show that she has a significant increase in her BUN and creatinine. Her BUN is in the 80's, and her creatinine is about 3.4. She states her breathing has been excellent, however. She is not experiencing as much dyspnea on exertion. She is sleeping through the night, and she is no longer having any kind of dry cough. Medications: Her current medicines are Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o. q.day, Paxil 20 p.o. q.day, Cozaar 50 p.o. q.day, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q. day, Atenolol 50 p.o. q.day, Lasix 120 p.o. b.i.d, Zaroxolyn 2.5 p.o. q.day, Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n, nph 40 units in the morning and 40 units at night time and aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.day. Allergies: Cephalexin causes questionable rash. Physical Examination: Today she is a pleasant black female in no acute distress. Her weight is 330 pounds. This is down over 20 pounds over the past month. Her blood pressure is 122\/80. Her pulse is 80. Her lungs are clear. Her heart reveals distant heart sounds but regular in rhythm and rate. Her extremities are notable for the absence of lower extremity edema. Her abdomen is also noted to be significantly less edematous than it has been in the past. Inspection of her left lower extremity reveals that she continues to have an ulcer over the lateral aspect of the foot on the plantar surface that measures 2 x 3 cm. There is beefy red granulation tissue surrounding this. Diagnosis: 1. Congestive heart failure. 2. Coronary artery disease, status post CABG. 3. Morbid obesity. 4. Adult onset diabetes mellitus. 5. Chronic renal insufficiency. 6. Foot ulcer. 7. Depression. 8. Health maintenance. Chandler, Jessica MRN: 748-80-38-0 07\/28\/70 Page Two Plan: 1. Congestive heart failure. She is doing much better on higher doses of diuretics with a weight loss of over 20 pounds since her last visit here about a month ago. At this point in time, however, I think that we need to cut back on her Zaroxolyn given the elevation in her BUN and creatinine, and I've asked her to hold her Zaroxolyn dosage and continue on a relatively low-fat and low-sodium diet and to have a scale and obtain daily weights, and she will follow-up with me in the office in two weeks and per telephone conversation in four days. Should she have an increase in her weight by more than five pounds, she will contact me. 2. Coronary artery disease, status post CABG. Stable without any symptoms of exertional chest pain. Continue current medication. 3. Morbid obesity. She decided not to go to the Frankfort State Hospital weight loss program. I strongly wanted her to go on a liquid protein diet plan, but she states it's inconvenient for her to come to the Hospital at night time for the meetings. She is planning to try and enroll in a program at Sibley Care. I told her I would help her out in any way possible, but strongly reinforced to her the need for her to take off weight. 4. Adult-onset diabetes mellitus. Stable. Continue current regimen. 5. Chronic renal insufficiency. The plan as above is to stop Zaroxolyn and repeat electrolytes in five days. 6. Diabetic foot ulcer. I also gave her a duoderm dressing to try, and she is going to continue to follow-up with her podiatrist, and I will speak with her visiting nurse about appropriate treatment. Ruby C.

Ishikawa, M.D. Surgery 03 Greenwood Drive Dyersville, WI 69617\nDear Hicks,\nI had the pleasure of seeing Hannah Hendricks in Internal Medicine today. She was seen alongside my attending, Dr. Heidi Erik-Roy. As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery. She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment. Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease. She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities. Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066. It appears that her right graft has been functioning well, but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago. She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe. You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.\nMs. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease. She has never had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.\nShe does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI. She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI. She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD.\nIn terms of her functional capacity, she tells me that up until a year ago, she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever. Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity, she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise. She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath. She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.\nHer past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump, peripheral arterial disease, status post bilateral lower extremity bypass, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\nHer current medications include aspirin 325 mg, which she started a few days ago, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Diovan 160 mg twice daily, vitamin C, vitamin B and folic acid supplementation.\nShe has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet.\nShe is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s. She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.\nAs I mentioned previously, her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s.\nOn physical examination, her blood pressure is 135\/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds. In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest. She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water. She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits. Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally. Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft 2\/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border. Her abdomen is benign. She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta. Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage, which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe. Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses. In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT.\nAn EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation. There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI. There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI.\nIn summary, Ms. Hendricks is a lovely 52-year-old female with longstanding diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft. She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago. However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction. As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery. Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery. However, I would start her on a beta-blocker and as such, I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily, which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period.\nDuring the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120\/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60. I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.\nWe will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning. If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI. I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed. As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good, I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results. This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.\nIt was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today. We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.\nSincerely,\n\nFatima K Baird, M.D.\n\n\neScription document:0-1465457 IFFocus\nCC: Trevon Schmidt M.D. 54 Clinton Street Decatur, WI 96857\n\nDD: 05\/01\/78 DT: 05\/02\/78 DV: 05\/01\/78\n\n* Record date: 2078-05-08\nED Surgery Consult Date\/Time: 5\/8\/78 4:56PM * Name: Hendricks, Hannah MRN# 75322175 Resident: Xavier G.

As you know, she is a 52-year-old woman with a history of peripheral vascular disease. She underwent a redo left femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft using basilic and cephalic vein from her right arm on May 3, 2078. She has done well since the procedure. She is now comes here complaining of left foot pain. She had an ultrasound in the vascular lab to rule out a DVT, which it did. She explains the discomfort as pain and burning in the bottom of her foot as well as her arch and over the dorsum of the foot.\nOn exam, she is a well appearing female in no acute distress. She is alert and oriented x3. She appears grossly neurologically intact. Her lower extremity exam reveals easily palpable bypass graft pulse in her left leg. Her left foot is warm and well perfused and she has a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe. This does not appear infected and I cannot probe to bone. It remains superficial. She has no other ischemic skin changes noted.\nI have discussed with Hannah that her discomfort most likely is due to peripheral neuropathy due to her diabetes. She also experienced this discomfort prior to her surgery. She is enquiring about starting Neurontin. I have said she would be able to try either Neurontin or Lyrica to help with the peripheral neuropathy. She will return next week for her postoperative graft scan to assess her circulation. She knows to contact us sooner if thing worsen.\nIf I can be of further assistance in her care, do not hesitate to contact me.\nSincerely,\nHunter Shea, MD\nDictated by: Quanisha Logan, PA-C\n\n* Record date: 2078-09-26\nDate 09\/26\/2078 Surgery ADMISSION NOTE\nPATIENT: Hendricks, Hannah\nMRN: 75322175\nAttending: Shea\n\nCC: L foot pain\n\nHPI: 52 y\/o F with Hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, PVD, s\/p R fem-pop bypass and L fem-DP bypass, both in 2066.

She was recently treated\nat an outside hospital for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis,\nhad a 2-day hospital stay, and was discharged home on Keflex.\nShe felt that she did have some improvement but over the past 48\nhours has had worsening erythema in lower extremities. She has\nalso been having some emesis, myalgias and fatigue, but has not\nhad any hematemesis, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or\nother symptomatology. She has also not noticed any urinary\nsymptoms of frequency.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Peripheral vascular disease, hypertension,\nhyperlipidemia, and diabetes.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Amputation to the left second, third and\nfifth toes, bilateral fem-pop bypasses right in 2061, left in\n2066 and anterior tibial bypass graft in 05\/2078.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and denies\ntobacco, alcohol, or drugs.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 146\/66, pulse 98,\nrespiratory rate 20, temperature 101.2, and O2 saturation 99% on\nroom air. General: This is a well-appearing woman in no\napparent distress. Respiratory: Clear to auscultation\nbilaterally, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezes. Cardiovascular:\nRegular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. GI: The\nabdomen is soft. The patient does have insulin pump in place,\nbut has no erythema or fluctuance over the pump. Skin is warm,\ndry, and intact with the exception of the left lower extremity,\nwhich is erythematous, warm and slightly swollen compared to the\nright lower extremity. This erythema stops at the ankle and does\nnot extend up above the knee. The patient also has an open\nchronic nonhealing wound on the plantar surface of her left foot\nas well. There is no erythema surrounding this wound Neurologic:\nAwake, alert, and oriented x3 except for some decreased\nsensation in her left foot, which is chronic.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was seen and evaluated\nby me and the resident. I confirm that I have seen and evaluated\nthe patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the\npatient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and\ndisposition with the patient as well as the resident.\nThe patient had a CBC and metabolic panel. CBC showed white\ncount of 14 with shift. LFTs were within normal limits. X-ray\nof her left foot showed no osteomyelitis seen on x-ray and x-ray\nof her tib-fib continued to show no osteomyelitis. Given the\nerythema and swelling, I was concerned about a cellulitis in this\nvasculopathic who was also diabetic and so we gave her a 1 g of\nvancomycin (especially given the fact that she has failed\noutpatient therapy with oral antibiotics) and we are admitting\nher to the Medicine Service for cellulitis. The patient's\nerythema and swelling does not extend to her foot and would be\nextremely atypical for a DVT. We also notified the Internal Medicine resident of the patient's admission to Medicine as she is\nfollowed closely by Surgery and this notification was\nmade at 8:30 p.m.\nGiven the fact that she does not have osteomyelitis at this point\nwe have not discussed the PICC line and given the fact that she\ndoes not have any abnormalities, I did not believe that she\nneeds pressors or aggressive hydration and we are starting her on\nmaintenance fluids, antibiotics, and admitting her to the\nhospital.\nDIAGNOSIS: Left lower extremity cellulitis.\nCONDITION: Stable.\nDISPOSITION: Admit to hospital.\n\nFAULKNER, GABRIAL MD\nD: 08\/05\/79\nT: 08\/05\/79\nDictated By: FAULKNER, GABRIAL\neScription document:7-11192535 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2095-08-21\nBailey EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT\n\nDARLING,BETTY 785-67-87-3\nResident history reviewed, the patient seen, interviewed, and\nexamined by me.\nHISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT: Briefly, the history is as\nfollows: The patient is a 75-year-old white female with past\nmedical history significant for throat cancer, status post\nradiation therapy; breast cancer, status post multiple\nlumpectomies; non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,\nhypothyroidism, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease with\nbilateral carotid stenosis - status post right carotid\nendarterectomy, who was seen earlier today at Faith Hospital\nafter an episode of word finding difficulty associated with acute\nvision loss in her left eye while riding as a passenger in a car.\nThe event was witnessed and reportedly there was severe word\nfinding difficulty.

She has stenosis in both anterior and posterior circulation. Past right carotid endarterectomy.\nIn August 2095, she was admitted to BMH with a right cerebellar stroke, complicated by a brief intubation and pneumonia. She underwent stenting of her right vertebral artery and left common carotid artery. She had subsequent episodes of worsening speech, and was started on Coumadin, with an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.0. She is followed closely by Neurology and may, at some point, undergo further interventional radiology procedures, to be determined.\nDuring her most recent hospitalization she had some confusion which was attributed to low sodium. This was felt to be the result of osmotic diuresis, and possible SIADH. This is being treated with salt tablets, saline boluses in her G-tube, water restriction, and low-dose Lasix. No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.\nSince leaving the hospital, she has had ongoing weight loss. Baseline weight 170 pounds. Weight in early September, 167 pounds. Weight October 20th, 160 pounds. Weight <PHI TYPE=DATE>November\n28th<\/PHI>, 141 pounds. Weight today in clinic 146 pounds on our scale.\nShe had a swallowing study on October 26, 2095, which revealed no aspiration, but very poor bolus formation. The G-tube was placed in August, and has healed well, but has never been used for daily tube feeds on an outpatient basis. Over the past couple of weeks, she has worsening trouble with coughing, choking and sputtering, as she attempts to swallow. Her caloric p.o. intake sounds as if it has been quite minimal, with a couple of ounces of potatoes or pureed foods here and there. She is drinking two or three can of booster Ensure daily, but clearly not meeting her caloric needs. Today's visit was with the patient, and her daughter (phone number 507.741.8042).\nMost recent laboratory studies, done 12\/7\/2095: Sodium 137, potassium 4.8, chloride 95, Bicarb 32, BUN 22, creatinine 1.0, calcium 9.9, glucose 162.\nThe patient has felt increasingly weak and debilitated, as her weight has decreased.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Also remarkable for slight bright red blood per rectum within the last week. The patient's daughter describes that she had a normal colonoscopy in early 2095, at the Richwood Area Community Hospital. The patient's daughter will bring me these records at the next visit.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Cerebrovascular disease, as noted above. 2. Throat cancer in early 2060s. Status post XRT to the neck (may have predisposed her to the severe carotid and vertebral disease). 3. Breast cancer. Details unknown. Will review at next visit. 4. Diabetes, type II. On glyburide. Further details unknown. 5. SIADH. Will review hospital chart in detail. 6. Hypertension. Per Neurology, goal blood pressure 140 to 170. 7. Hypothyroidism. Details unknown. Recent TSH normal. 8. Glaucoma. 9. Anxiety. Being followed by Psychiatry on an active basis. This was apparently a large factor during her recent hospitalizations. 10. Possible recent anemia. Has not been evaluated thus far.\nMEDICATIONS: 1. Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. 2. Synthroid 100 mcg p.o. q.d. 3. Lasix 10 mg p.o. Qa m and Qpm 4. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d. 6. Enteric-coated baby aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. 7. Sodium chloride 1 g p.o. Qa m via G-tube 8. Timolol 0.5%, one drop to the right eye q.d. 9. Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q.d. 10. Normal saline 300 cc via G-tube after breakfast, lunch, and dinner 11. Multivitamin p.o. q.d. 12. Coumadin, with goal INR 2.5 to 3.0 (followed by Internal Medicine) 13. Xalatan 0.005%, one drop each eye q.h.s. 14. Dulcolax 5 mg p.o. q.d. PRN, constipation 15. Risperdal 0.125 mg to 0.25 mg p.o. q.h.s. PRN 16. Ambien 5 mg to 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. PRN 17. Saliva substitute PRN 18. Nystatin, swish-and-swallow PRN 19. Fleet Enema PRN 20. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. PRN\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has four children. Her daughter Fitzpatrick is a Food Service Supervisor. Another daughter is staying with the patient full-time. Visiting nurse is involved. Previous to the last few months, the patient was fairly independent.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Cachectic, anxious woman, who is slightly unsteady on her feet, but safe with ambulation if she moves slowly and carefully. Has a cane, but does not always use it. VITAL SIGNS: BP 214\/108, initially (patient very anxious), and 171\/74 on repeat. Pulse 80. Weight 146.5 pounds, fully clothed. ABDOMEN: With good bowel sounds. Soft, nontender and nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. G-tube is flushed with water, and flushes easily. G-tube site itself is well-healed and nontender, with no pussy discharge. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Weight loss. Probably due to poor caloric intake. This is a significant health concern for her, as she has become progressively cachectic and weak. This is probably attributed to, by some extent, her progressive dysphagia. She is referred urgently to Nutrition, and will see them on Tuesday. I suggested to the daughter and to the nutritionist that we transition her to tube feeds for at least a couple of weeks, to get her muscle mass up, and then reevaluate. She should continue to take p.o. foods as tolerated, but she needs to attempt to meet her caloric intake via the G-tube, since she is clearly not meeting it p.o. Will try Glucerna because of her diabetes history. The patient's daughter and the nutritionist are aware of her issues with vitamin K and Coumadin, and they will discuss this further when she sees Nutrition Clinic in two days. 2. Cerebrovascular disease. Followed closely by Neurology. No acute change in neuro status today. Will continue Coumadin. Being followed closely by Internal Medicine for this. Recent INR 1.4. Will adjust Coumadin as advised by IM nurse. 3. SIADH. I need to review these records more closely, and try to make sure there is no other underlying disorder. In the meantime, her sodiums have been quite good recently. 4. Diabetes. Recent hyperglycemia, with sugars in the 300 to 350 range. Most recently, with sugars in the 100 to 200 range over the past few days. Continue glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. Finger-sticks three to four times daily. Further adjustments PRN. Our current goal is simply to maintain her sugars between 120 and approximately 220 to 250. Once her dietary issues are stabilized, we can aim for slightly tighter control. Wish to avoid hypoglycemia, given her troubles with p.o. intake. 5. Recent history of bright red blood per rectum. Daughter will bring me her recent colonoscopy report, and we will take it from there. 6. Constipation. Continue Colace. Add Dulcolax PRN. Continue Fleet Enema PRN by visiting nurse. If she does have chronic constipation, this may impact her appetite and her ability to eat successfully. 7. Hypertension. Currently in reasonable control. Goal BP 140 to 170, systolic. Initial severe hypertension this visit, attributed to anxiety, which clearly is a major issue for her. Follow-up at next visit. 8. Anxiety. Followed by Psychiatry. Extensive reassurance given today to the patient. She is very concerned about her weight loss, as am I. I tried to reassure her that we would take this seriously and address it in a very rapid fashion.\nAddendum - spoke with psych - they will start paxil 5 mg qd\nwatch for worsening SIADH and\/or anthicholinergic side effects. 9. Multiple other issues. To be addressed at further visits. Given her weight loss and complexity, I will see her on a weekly basis for the next few weeks, or sooner PRN. Daughter has my pager number, and knows how to reach me.\nJulia Yale, M.D.\nCC:\neScription document:0-136282 ST eScription\nDD: 12\/09\/95 DT: 12\/09\/95 DV: 12\/09\/95\n\n* Record date: 2097-11-30\nCookson Memorial Home Internal Medicine Room 960 50 Wellesley Rd DARLING, BETTY Seattle, SC 84126 78567873 (121) 537-3484 11\/30\/97\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Hypertension, proteinuria, status post fall, reevaluate Coumadin.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Urgent care visit for this 77-year-old woman with the history of diabetes, multiple strokes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple other issues. Last week she was at Saint Joseph Memorial Hospital for an eye evaluation. It was a very very windy day. Afterwards she was outside and a huge gust of wind knocked her over. Her daughter Fitzpatrick was with her and Fitzpatrick herself actually had to hold on to something when the wind blew. There is no chest pain or presyncope, and no loss of consciousness either before, during, or after the episode. She struck her left trochanteric area, left deltoid area, and left eyebrow. She was taken to EFH where she had a normal head CT. A single stitch was placed in the laceration along the lateral edge of her left eyebrow. She had films of her wrist and hips both of which were fine. She has bruising in these areas. Other than some pain where the bruising is she feels entirely back to normal.\nShe had marked hypertension up to 250. She was treated with hydralazine in the ER, and was noted to have proteinuria with some hematuria. Her blood pressure at home since then has been 180 and 210 systolic on her usual 40 mg daily of lisinopril. She is not on a beta-blocker currently. She has not had any episodes of chest pain. She does feel slightly more woozy than usual.\nMEDICATIONS: Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d, Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q.d, atorvastatin 10 mg q.d, sertraline 50 mg q.d, warfarin, lisinopril 40 mg q.d, Ambien 10 mg q.h.s. p.r.n, levothyroxine 100 mg p.o. q.d, aspirin, eyedrops, Colace, and Dulcolax.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She is looking forward to a good Christmas. She is here today with her daughter Fitzpatrick.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 97.2, pulse 74, BP 208\/66, weight 148 pounds. GENERAL: Well appearing woman. HEENT: PERRL. Single stitch along the lateral aspect of her left eyebrow is easily removed. No evidence of any infection. Her left deltoid area is fine and she has good range of motion in the shoulder. Her left ribcage is slightly tender but without any bony step-offs. She walks well with no pain in her left hip. There is a hand sized deep purple bruise over the trochanteric bursa.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mechanical fall with laceration and bruising but no more serious complications. Fortunately she did not have intracranial bleeding. I am not sure why her blood pressure is up, whether this is related to the stress of the falls verses independent causes. Given that the high blood pressure has persisted, I will add atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.d, and discuss via phone or E-mail with her daughter next week to see how well this is working. Goal BP 140-160 systolic. Her urine was checked today. Hematuria has resolved. She has 2+ proteinuria. I will recheck this in a week or two after we treat her hypertension.\nWe spent over half of today's 45-minute visit discussing risks and benefits of Coumadin therapy. Although she is at risk for falls, she feels quite clearly that she prefers to be on the Coumadin due to her fear of having a repeated thrombotic stroke. She feels that she has not had any bleeding complications, and that she really would not like to suffer through another stroke. I explained that there was some risk with falls of intracranial hemorrhage and its consequences. I spoke with Dr. Dewitt last month about her Coumadin, and we both feel that it seems to be working well in terms of stroke prevention, but that she is at increased risk for falls. It seems to me that she is in a gray area with no clear right answer in terms of risk benefit analysis for Coumadin for her. She feels very strongly that she wishes to continue. This was discussed in detail with her and her daughter, and this probably is a reasonable decision. I encouraged her to restart physical therapy to work on her strength and hopefully diminish her risk of a subsequent fall. More than half of today's 45-minute visit spent in patient counseling and education.\n\n\nJulia Yale, M.D.\nDictated By: Julia Yale\neScription document:3-5285833 EMSSten Tel\n\nDD: 11\/30\/97 DT: 11\/30\/97 DV: 11\/30\/97\n\n* Record date: 2098-06-13\nBetty has been doing okay since our last visit; she continues to report a slow decline in swallowing ability. She had a video swallow at SJMH; she and Fitzpatrick were told that the underlying problem was local changes due to her radiation. Her gait has been unchanged, but she still feels it has deteriorated a little over the last year.\n\nShe is gardening, and trying to stay active; she has had no falls and uses a cane.\n\nShe recently added amlodipine for her hypertension.\n\n\nEchocardiogram:\nDate: 9\/02\/95: borderline LVH, preserved EF. Posterobasal HK. Not done for PFO.\n\nBrain & Vessel Studies:\nMRI\/A:\nCTA:\n3\/20\/98: severe proximal LICA stenosis, just distal to bifurcation.no comment on comparison.\n9\/29\/95: >90% RCCA, unchanged from the exam of 9\/04\/95. >90% LCCA proximal to the stent with elevated flow velocities within the stent. 70-75% LICA. The estimation of stenosis in the left internal carotid artery may be low because of tandem stenoses in the left carotid artery. Compared to the study of 9\/04\/95, the LICA lesion is modestly worse. >50% in B ECAs.\n9\/26\/95: Lbif stenosis >= 50%. Rbif without significant stenosis. RVA dominant.\nUltrasound:\n8\/24\/95: Low RCCA 50-75%, Mid LCCA 75-90%, calcified LICA possibly >50%\nAngiography:\n8\/27\/95: proximal RCCA stenosis >80%, ACA cross-filling from L-->R. Right vertebral irregular\/stenotic.

Cognitively, she appears unchanged; her speech is fluent, with intact repetition and comprehension, and her recall of recent events (corroborated by her daughter) is good.\n\nPupils are equal and reactive, EOMI, VFFTC. Face, tongue and palate are symmetric, but she is dysarthric; glottal sounds worst. This sounds slightly worse than our previous visit. Strength is full in all extremities; her mild dysmetria is unchanged. Her walk, always wide-based and slightly unsteady, appears mildly worse than our previous visit, but she is not using a cane, and is able to catch herself after mild stumbles. She is unable to tandem gait.\n\nImpression:\nBetty is a 78 year old woman with progressive cerebrovascular disease due to local radiation, plus diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia. She is s\/p left ICA stents and right VA angioplasty. Her most significant vascular lesion is stenosis proximal to the ICA stent, but there is no hint now of transient or orthostatic symptoms.\n\nMy continued feeling is that we ought to focus on her controllable risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, as you are doing. I understand you have recently been adjusting her antihypertensive regimen. I would recommend a goal systolic blood pressure no lower than 120 mmHg.\n\nI think a reasonable way to approach this is to use (1) her clinical status, and (2) 'functional' imaging, such as Diamox SPECT, to follow her cerebrovascular disease. I think intervention would be warranted if there were a deterioration in one of these parameters.\n\nI have not yet heard from Howard Yelverton about his thoughts regarding the recent scan, but I did review the CT scans with neuroradiology. Our impression is that, while the wording of the reports seems to suggest significant progression of the LICA stenosis, it's not significant enough to prompt us to act, in the absence of symptomatic or functional changes.\n\nI am ordering a Diamox SPECT scan, since the previous one was in July of last year.\n\nThis is my last general neurology clinic at BMH; I will be a neuromuscular fellow here next year. While I can be available for questions or concerns, I will be referring Betty's care to one of the more junior residents.\n\n\nElvin Cox MD, MBA\nBMH Neurology\n\n\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2073-10-24\n10\/24\/73 This is my first visit with Teresa Hardy (MR#36052413), a 54 yo F here to meet her new PCP.

No seizure activity. He was brought to BMH where he indicated he had had 2 similar episodes in previous month. Concern for cardiac orig1n given lack of posterior fossa signs, orthostasis at BMH, hx of seizure symptoms, and significant trauma. He ruled out for MI, had TTE showing EF 59% but had inf. WMA and LA dilation. Cardiology was therefore consulted. An adenoMIBI stress test was later performed and revealed mild inf. lat reversible ischemia, therefore a LHCath was performed and showed moderate non-intervenable lesions in the RCA and distal PLV. The patient also underwent an EP study that was non-diagnostic. An implantable loop recorder was placed on 6\/21. Other work up of syncope included CNIs showing mild RICA stenosis; neurology consult thought these findings were unlikely to be the cause of his syncope and agreed with continued evaluation of cardiac etiologies. In hospital, was noted that pt had had 40 lb weight loss over previous months. Surgery was consulted regarding prompt need for intervention of a known hernia, their evaluation was that the hernia was benign without signs of obstruction and there was no need for inpatient intervention. Endocrine w\/u included nl TSH and cortstim. The patient had had a recent Chest and Abd CT and colonoscopy that had no evidence of pancreatic or colonic massess. SPEP and BNP wnl and; his PSA was elevated at 9.56, however alk phos, bone survey, bone scan were all normal. The patient's nutrition and PO intake improved greatly s\/p treatment for constipation with an aggressive bowel regimen. Just prior to d\/c, after returning from an uncomplicated EP study the patient started to exhibit inappropriate behavior (showing stool when not requested to staff) and stating bizarre thoughts (I lost my mortal soul). Psychiatry was consulted and suspected the patient was having a psychotic episode in setting of prolonged hospitalization and multiple diagnostic interventions. It was concluded that an inpatient geri-psych hospitalization was required.\nHospitalization done on Psych floor. Per psych eval, pt had been withdrawn and depressed for 8 months with poor sleep, anhedonia, and decreased energy. The pt believed that he had died some time ago and was currently in hell. He stated that he had been feeling that he had sinned so horribly, that God could not forgive him. He stated that he had died, and then further stated that by this he meant that though he might be physically alive, because he could not be forgiven, he was for all intents and purposes, spiritually dead. He had been having vivid dreams and had been told that he had exalted himself above god and for that would be punished. On the inpt ward, Mr. Shepherd was started on zyprexa 5 mg which was titrated up to a dose of 20 mg qHS. Cymbalta was initiated and titrated up to 60mg qDay with gradual and signficant improvement in his mood. The patient also expressed difficulty sleeping which responded to Remeron 15mg. At the time of discharge, the patient reported good appetite, adequate sleep (about 8 hours a night, occasional awakening with nocturia), and significant improvement of his depression. He further noted that his thoughts of being doomed to hell were still occasionally present, though much less intense than upon admission, and he reported that he was able to challenge this belief most of the time.\nNeuropsych testing performed during inpt stay showing significant cognitive impairment. He had global deficits in language, memory, visual-spatial abilities, executive functioning, and attention. He had very poor learning of new information. Pt was discharged to home with an intake appointment in the Jones Hospital Psychiatry scheduled for the following day.\nHe has since followed up with Frances Talley, where Zyprexa dose slowly tapered to decrease grogginess. Today, patient reports improved mood, no longer feels down, no longer feels guilty, as though in hell. Has continued to taper down Zyprexa to 3.75mg QHS. Saw Dr. Nobles on Wednesday, felt that patient should continue to stay on low dose Zyprexa for now. Pt as fell has been tapering down Cymbalta as well, taking it QOD.\nReports some intermittent aches in right groin secondary to inguinal hernia.

They were associated with a prodrome of lightheadedness and weakness that sometimes occurred with positional changes and at other times at rest. He denied associated chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, vertigo, focal neurologic weakness, dysphagia, diplopia or blurry vision occur during the episodes. These spells lasted about 4-5 minutes and there were no incontinence, post-ictal symptoms, or tonic-clonic movements.\nHis workup included a surface echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 59% but with inferior wall motion abnormalities. A subsequent adenosine MIBI showed mild inferolateral ischemia and a cardiac catheterization showed 40% ostial RCA disease and a 75% lesion in a small diameter distal PLV. The culprit lesion was felt to be non-intervenable and the patient was started on medical therapy. During his admission, his telemetry showed a twelve beat run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and so the electrophysiology service was called. He underwent an electrophysiology study which was nondiagnostic and a REVEAL monitor was implanted. Prior to his discharge, the patient exhibited features of depression with psychotic features and he was ultimately transferred to the in-patient psychiatry unit for about four weeks.\nToday, he presents with no acute complaints. He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations. He s had no further fainting spells and reports that his last REVEAL interrogation was unremarkable. His claudication is at his baseline. He walks at a mall for 30 minutes to 1 hour before he experiences a tired sensation in both legs. He is followed in the vascular clinic at the FHV medical center. Also of note, he underwent a repair of a right inguinal hernia in October of 2094 by Dr. Small without complications.\nPast medical history: Coronary artery disease *status post cardiac catheterization showing 40% ostial RCA disease and distal PLV disease *medical therapy, no intervention Diabetes mellitus, type 2 Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Benign prostatic hypertrophy Right external carotid stenosis Peripheral vascular disease with claudication *followed at FHV vascular clinic Glaucoma Ventral hernia\n\nAllergies: No known allergies\nMedications (Confirmed):\nASA 325mg po daily brimonidine 0.2% x 1 drop ou bid Cardura 4mg po daily Cymbalta 60mg po daily Removed - Lasix 20mg po daily lisinopril 40mg po daily MiraLax 17g PO daily Pletal 100mg PO bid senna 2tabs PO bedtime Toprol XL 100mg po daily Zocor 80mg po qpm Zyprexa 3.75mg po at bedtime\nFamily history: Mom MI at age 63; grandson w\/ h\/o sudden LOC at age 16 with negative w\/u by peds; otherwise, no h\/o sudden death.\nSocial history: Retired Archive Manager who lives with wife; has 6 children\nHRB: quit smoking 20 years ago 40 pack-yr smoking history; no EtOH; no drugs\nReview of systems: General: unremarkable Skin: unremarkable HEENT: unremarkable Respiratory: unremarkable Cardiovascular: see above Gastrointestinal: unremarkable Genitourinary: nocturia Endocrine: unremarkable Musculoskeletal: unremarkable Neurologic: unremarkable Psychiatric: unremarkable\nPhysical examination: -BMI: 30.2 Obese, high risk -Pulse: 56 regular -resp. rate: 100% room air -height: 68 in. -weight: 198 lbs. -General: pleasant and in no distress -Skin: unremarkable -HEENT: PERRL EOMI OP clear -Neck: bilateral carotid bruits; JVP~5 cm normal contours, no Kussmaul's -Chest: CTAB no dullness -Cardiac: Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced.

Patient&#8217;s fall does appear to be mechanical by history. Her RCRI would be Class I-II, placing her at low to intermediate risk for this intermediate risk procedure. Given that she is on beta-blockade, she should be continued with use of short acting beta-blocker (i.e, lopressor) while here in the hospital. Her chronic venous stasis change is likely due to previous bilateral DVTs based on her history. This can be evaluated postoperatively as it may affect decisions regarding potential anticoagulation.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Please change patient from atenolol to lopressor 37.5 mg PO Q8hours, to be held for HR < 55 and SBP < 100\n- Please check ECG postoperatively along with troponin on Day 1 and Day 4 postoperatively\n- Please implement high risk DVT prophylaxis postoperatively with lovenox 30 mg SC BID\n- Please schedule LENIs postoperatively as is tolerated based on surgery. Would need to discuss benefits\/risks of ongoing anticoagulation with family if positive\n\nThank you for this interesting consult.

She was seen by ortho, and they recommended use of an Aspen collar for the dens fracture, and no operative management for the pubic ramus fracture. On 11\/15, patient was noted to have a decreased Hct, which was attributed to an expanding hematoma on her right thigh, and she was given 2 U of PRBCs from 9:30am-5pm on 11\/15. Overnight her O2 requirement increased from 2L to 4L, and she was given Lasix in response to a chest X-ray which showed signs of pulmonary edema.

A temperature of 105.6 with no obvious infectious source does make infection seem less likely, however patient will be treated empirically with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and levoquin for possible hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia or meningitis. An LP will be attempted if it can be safely done without compromising the patient&#8217;s respiratory status, and in the context of the patient&#8217;s tremor. In the context of recently receiving Seroquel, Zyprexa and Fluoxetine, it is also possible that patient could have either serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which could explain the patient&#8217;s elevated CK, elevated WBC, elevated LFTs, extremely high temperature and tremor with rigidity.\nContinue to follow lytes, CK, CBC Small doses of Ativan for tremor\/anxiety AVOID all neuroleptics (typical and atypical) Continue antibiotics, F\/U cultures\n\nISSUE #2: Type III Dens fracture and pubic rami fracture.\nKeep in C collar, manage rami fracture medically\n\nISSUE #3: DM.

We are asked to consult for periop risk eval prior to ORIF.1. Periop cardiac risk: Pt&#8217;s RCRI is zero, and has no Hx CAD. Now, as she as in RVR to 140s, she has no ST depressions. Pt does not need periop beta blockade from a risk perspective, but should continue on home beta blockade given her HTN and now new AF.2. new AF: pt is now in new AF\/RVR, asymptomatic, after missing her AM atenolol. She is getting 5mg IV lopressor plus 25 mg po lopressor in the ED, hopefully this will provide some rate control. She should continue on BB.- try 37.5 mg lopressor q8h; hold for HR <60, SBP <100- it is possible that arrhythmia may precipitate falls. She may benefit from a holter monitor as an outpatient, to see whether she is frequently in AF, or whether this was precipitated by illness and missing BB (more likely).- keep pt on tele while in house3. Hx NMS\/serotonin syndrome: pt carries a dx of NMS from prior med use the last time she was hospitalized for hip surgery (see CAS notes 11\/16\/77). However, pt is elderly and with hx of dementia, is at risk for postop dementia. Given this, avoid anti-dopaminergic meds like haldol, seroquel, zydis\/zyprexa, reglan. This pt tolerates small doses of benzo as a home med, therefore pt can try:- home klonopin 0.25mg po bid standing- ativan 0.5 mg q6h prn agitation- monitor for signs of NMS: mental status changes with muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability. Check CK if this happens and page med consult 06885 if any concerns.Thank you for this consult. We will follow with you.

He went to bed\nand woke up today with continued symptoms.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Besides his past medical history, he has a\nsignificant CAD in his grandfather with CHF. His father died at\nearly age of 19 of a traumatic accident.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She does not drink and does not smoke.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He himself has had no surgeries except a\ncholecystectomy.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Shortness of breath, no chest pain, no\nlightheadedness, no leg swelling, no palpitations, and came in\nacutely diaphoretic with shortness of breath.\nMEDICATIONS: Lantus, glipizide, Zocor, atenolol, and was\nrecently started insulin as above a week ago.\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mildly obese gentleman with a pulse of\n100, respiratory rate 28, O2 saturation 97 on 4 L, blood pressure\n132\/69, and temperature 98.1. HEENT is anicteric. Neck is\nsupple. Heart is regular rate and rhythm although distant heart\nsounds. He is tachypneic but no obvious wheezes. He has soft\nabdomen.

He had some purulent D\/C from rectum and worsening of glucose control. He was seen in EDUCARE-PULLMAN Urgent Care on 1\/21\/77 at which time a small erythematous and tender cyst was noted between his buttocks. He was prescribed sitz baths and Keflex for pilonidol cyst vs. ruptured boil. He was seen again in EDUCARE-PULLMAN on 1\/29\/77 at which time he reported resolution of his buttock pain. He denied fevers or neurologic symptoms. Exam was notable for only a tiny pustule in the upper gluteal cleft, minimally erythematous, non-tender, without drainage. On the morning of 2\/01\/77 he developed worsening of his shortness of breath, followed by the development of left jaw pain, and cold sweats, so he presented to the MANAMANA ED. On presentation, he also admitted to three days of scrotal and perineal pain and swelling. In the ED he was tachycardic to 113, normotensive, initially low-grade fever, but later spiked to 102.9. On examination, there was severe bilateral testicular swelling and pain, with a fluctuant mass between the rectum and scrotum. His WBC was 18,000 with 91% PMNs. An abdominal CT revealed extensive subcutaneous edema in the perineum, with multiple foci of air consistent with a necrotizing infection; and extensive fluid in the scrotum, consistent with Fournier's gangrene. The patient was treated with IV Abx and was taken urgently to the OR, where he underwent extensive debridement at which time substantial necrosis and pus were discovered. He was admitted to the SICU and has since undergone multiple debridements, last on 2\/20\/77.\nIn terms of his DM, he has type 2 diagnosed in October 2075. At the time he was feeling lousy, tired, nauseated, and increased urinary frequency: went to Payson Hospital and FS was 376. Pt was admitted overnight and given insulin; started on Metformin 500 bid, eventually insulin was added. He was being followed by Dr. Talley at the Promptcare but stopped going there.

Considering his current requirement of at least 120 U IV\/24h on top of his SQ doses, he will probably need close to 100 U q12h.

Increase NPH to 80 U q12h 2. Titrate NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed 3. Please make sure that in the Instructions to the NPH order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc\/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose (especially if pt transfers to floor) 4.

MANAMANA MR#: 6767510 PCP: Henry Jenkins, M.D. (503 155-7742) PSYCH: Brittany Prince, M.D. CONTACT: Mother, Haley Vaughn (158 857-4114) SOURCE: Patient; M.D. Passoff; Previous Medical Records PRECAUTIONS: MRSA; VRE PRIMARY SERVICE: Psychiatry Service (Internal Medicine) CONSULT DATE: 6\/19\/77 TIME: 2:00 PM CC: Suicidal ideation REASON for CONSULT: Evaluation for history of medical problems\nHPI: Pt is a 33 y.o. male with HTN, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for Fournier&#8217;s gangrene at MANAMANA, and depression, who was transferred to the MANAMANA Psychiatry by his MEDIQUIK psychiatrist, Dr. Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation. Dr. Prince had arranged involuntary hospitalization for this pt with campus security and EMS, prior to his arrival for the appointment. However, per Mr. Vaughn, he arrived to the appointment only with the expectation of discussing his depression and refilling his Celexa, which he has been unable to take for the past 2 weeks, due to an expired prescription. Dr. Prince documents a discussion in which the pt was tearful and emotional, while describing active suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose on oxycodone. He reportedly had several episodes this past week, where he had more than a hundred oxycodone pills in his hand, but did not follow through on his plans. Given concern for imminent danger, a Section 12 was completed, and pt was transferred to the MANAMANA ED.\nThe pt does admit to phobias of the hospital, and strong desire to avoid admission. However, he states that his last suicidal ideation was approximately 2 weeks ago, and that he changed his mind, once he realized his mother&#8217;s soon-to-be ex-husband, who has been threatening her, will be released from prison soon. Moreover, he states that he has been taking all his medications, checking his insulin at least four times a day for his sliding scale, and changing the dressings on his sacral and scrotal wounds, with intent to improving his health.\nThe Medical Service was asked to evaluate the pt for active and impending medical issues prior to admission to a Psychiatry Service.\nPMH\/PSH 1. Depression: Symptoms since age 12. 2. IDDM2: Diagnosed at age 18. Was previously on oral hypoglycemics, but now on insulin. When pt had lost weight and down to 210 lbs, he did not require insulin.

Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum. All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis. Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB. His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control. He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid. His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen. The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments. His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily 2. Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner. If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose 3. Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks 4. No concentrated sweets diet 5. Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily 6. Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner) 7. Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia 8. Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked 9.

Present in with two large altars to the right lower extremity. He is status post hospitalization and some debridement and appears to have had little overall improvement in clinical status. I will proceed with an aggressive outpatient treatment plan however I suspect that he will need inpatient admission once again if significant improvement is not rapidly obtained. A referral has been made to the Island Medical Center wound clinic for this Tuesday. Visiting nurse has been arranged for his home for wound care in the interim. He is advised to avoid all weight-bearing and to keep his foot dressed at all times. I have explained to the patient that he is at risk of amputation of at least his right great toe should his healing not improve.\nWith regards to his other medical issues, he continues on dialysis.

Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial. S\/P Rt TMA. Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.\nBy issue:\n1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance. The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management. If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option. In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.\nCertainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx. I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture. If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.\n2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start. He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes. Please d\/c medications that might be contributing to sx. Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior. Might hold ranitidine as well. Haldol is d\/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc. Currently on olanzapine. Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d\/c this med as well is still prolonged. Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.\n3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound. Levofloxacin has been d\/cd 2nd to concerns for altered mental status. All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative. Would seek ID input to the end. Wound care per vascular with plans for D\/C when stable and return for closure in the future. 4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today. Recs per nephrology 3) DM: HgA1c was at target. Please cover as needed with RISS for now. 5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time. Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP. Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.

He said he has been perfectly fine, in his usual self, when he went to the grocery store, although the days have been humid. He has AC at home. However, about 5-10 minutes before he fell, he felt hot and sweaty, but didn't think too much of it. After finishing shopping in the store, he went out to the car to open the trunk, and while he was trying to put the key in the keyhole, he lost consciousness and fell to the ground. According to the witnesses at the scene (his sisters), he lost consciousness for about 1-2 minutes, and he quickly came back to himself but did not remember what had happened to him. No head trauma.\n\nOther than feeling hot and sweaty, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, vision changes, focal limb weakness, slurring of speech, and bowel or bladder incontinence. No prior event similar to this, although w\/ h\/o vertigo dx in 2090. He said he has been drinking his usual amount of fluid (but not more than usual) and did not notice any lightheadedness or dizziness at home.\n\nAt the ED, his vitals were stable, with T97.4, HR 66, BP 126\/61, R 16, and 100% on RA.

Syncope: Most likely etiology of his syncopal episode is vasovagal\/ neurocardiogenic, considering the presence of prodromal symptoms (sweating, feeling warm) 5 minutes before the event. It is possible that the patient has been dehydrated, considering the last couple days have been very humid, and he hasn't changed his fluid intake. However, the sudden onset of his syncope and LOC for 1-2 minutes concerning for cardiogenic causes as well: including sinus brady and other arrhythmic events. Ischemic event is less likely in this man. EKG showed no significant changes compared to the previous one, and he has known MR evidenced on his TTE in 2090.\nOther possible causes include:\nNeurologic: unlikely with no focal neuro symptoms both witnessed at the time and currently. However, the possibilities include basilar insufficiency.\nOthers: Finger stick glucose on the field 130, and Hct 36.8 (baseline) ruling out hypoglycemia and anemia as an etiology.\nPlan:\n1) Continue hydration overnight.\n2) Tele monitor to detect any abnormal heart rhythm.\n3) Continue to rule out with enzymes to rule out ischemia.\n4) TTE to assess any focal site for arrhythmogenic events.\n5) TCD and carotid duplex ultrasound to rule out basilar insufficieny, although he displays no signs of it on physical exam.\n\n2. DM: Pt diagnosed with type 2 DM approximately 12 years ago. Seems to be in a good control, with only diet and exercise modification. Per pt, the last HgbA1c was in 5-6 range.\n1) Diabetic diet, RSSI.\n2) Q6h finger stick check.\n3) Check HgbA1c in AM.\n\n3. L ankle swelling: Most likely from sprain while falling down during the syncope. Tender to palpation and with joint movement. No signs of infection. Good peripheral pulses and intact sensations.\n1) L ankle plain films to rule out fracture.\n2) PT consult.\n\n4. FEN: Electrolytes all within normal range, except slightly low Mg (1.5). Eating PO. On IVF for hydration.\n1) Replete Mg.\n2) K now 3.6. If low in AM, replete for the goal of 4.\n3) Diabetic diet for nutrition.\n\n5. Prophylaxis: Ranitidine, heparin.\n\n8. Dispo: PT consult. Anticipate home discharge.\n\nName Shawn Ott\nPager # 56770\nPGY-1\n\n\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2092-10-11\n\n\nInternal Medicine - MSIII Admission Note\n\nPt: Crawford, Patrick (Mary 3562Z)\nMR#: 902-15-55\nDate of Admission: 10\/10\/92\nAttending: Yancey, Ursula\nPCP: Estep, Willa\nCode status: Full\n\n\nCC: Generalized weakness + diaphoresis\n\nHPI: Pt is an 82 yo man with a history of diet-controlled DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago who presents with an episode of profuse diaphoresis and generalized weakness while cooking in his home at 10am this morning. He had recently returned home from grocery shopping, carrying 6 bags of groceries up 1 flight to his apartment, and was moving about his kitchen cooking when he felt suddenly drenched in sweat. He immediately felt lightheaded, disoriented, nauseous, generally weak, and as though he was about to faint. He was able to walk a few steps, sit down, and rest for 15-20min before he realized his symptoms weren't resolving, called his sister, and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak. He denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, flushes, fever\/chills, HA, visual changes, vomiting, and focal weakness associated with the episode. He felt he had been drinking adequate fluids, had no recent infections\/cough\/rhinorrhea, had no weight loss, and no exposures. When his sister arrived he told her to call 911, and soon he was brought to the SOH ED.\n\nOne month PTA, Mr. Crawford had been in his usual state of health when he had his first ever feeling of lightheadedness and diaphoresis while grocery shopping. Five minutes later while getting into his car, he had increasing lightheadedness and lost consciousness, falling to the ground with no head trauma. As with today's episode, he denied prior CP, SOB, palpitations and other symptoms previously listed. According to his sisters who were present at the time, he regained consciousness 2 minutes later, and he recalls knowing exactly where he was but not what had happened to him. He did not lose continence of bladder or bowel. He was brought to the ED, where his vitals were stable with a BP of 126\/61 and HR 66, and was admitted for observation and workup. Head CT was negative for an acute process, CXR was clear, EKG showed some LA enlargement and mild ST \/ Twave changes consistent with an EKG of 2yrs ago, negative cardiac enzymes, and a cardiac echo showing mild MR, an elongated LA, and an EF of 68%. At the time of discharge he was instructed to stop taking Prazosin for his BPH and instead take Flomax.\n\nIn the past month, Mr. Crawford has had no repeat syncopal episodes, but many episodes of diaphoresis with very mild lightheadedness. He reports that at least every few days he either has a brief diaphoresis episode during his daily activities, or sometimes a profuse diaphoresis that can occur while lying in bed and causing him to change his clothes and bedsheets. He has had no other symptoms. Of note, this morning he had run out of Flomax due to an insurance issue, and resumed taking 4mg of leftover Prazosin for his BPH around 6am. He disliked the Flomax because it seemed to cause polyuria and generally made him feel 'off' in an unidentifiable way. Currently the pt feels slightly lightheaded\/'woozy', sometimes worse with positional changes, and still generally weak, with no other symptoms.\n\nPMH: - DM2: diagnosed 2080, initially took an oral hypoglycemic agent for 6mo, but since has been managed by diet and exercise only.

Episode occurred in setting of frequent diaphoresis episodes in the past 1mo, and with medication change from Flomax to Prazosin this morning 4hrs prior to current episode. No LOC, CP, SOB, or seizure-like activity. No focal deficits and non-orthostatic on exam with strength intact. Stable Hct. Likely etiologies include:\n\n1. Arrhythmia, including sick sinus. EKGs demonstrate mild LA enlargement, old V1\/V2 Q waves. Could predispose to atrial fib or conduction abnormalities. Sick sinus not seen on EKG, but common cause of pre-syncope.\n\n2. Vertebrobasilar\/Carotid stenosis. Basilar territory could lead to dizziness; would expect more focal findings if carotid etiology, unless bilateral blockage.\n\n3. Prazosin-induced hypotension. In light of very recent change back to Prazosin, which has more vascular\/peripheral alpha-1 antagonism than does the more prostate-specific Flomax, could result in cerebral hypoperfusion.\n\n4. Neurocardiogenic\/Carotid hypersensitivity.\n\n\nPlan:\n\nPre-syncope: - ROMI with 2nd and 3rd set of cardiac markers\n- Telemetry\n- 24 hr Holter monitor\n- Carotid Doppler and Posterior Transcranial Doppler\n- Check lytes, CBC + diff in a.m.\n- IVF: NS 500cc at 75cc\/hr\n- Continue Lisinopril, HCTZ but discontinue Prazosin as inpatient\n- ASA qod as at home, consider qd\n\nDM2: - Check glucose in a.m.\n- No insulin requirement; order diabetic diet\n\nOA: - Motrin 400mg bid; check BUN\/Cr and U\/A for evidence of AIN or ATN\n\nGout: - Continue Allopurinol\n\nOptho: - Continue home regimen of Truopt, Artificial tears, etc.\n\n\n\n\nLeon Xayachack\nPager #76680\n\nI have seen and examined the patient wtih Leon and agree with his assessment.\n\n\n* Record date: 2094-04-16\nInternal Medicine Admission Note\nName: Crawford, Patrick MR#: 9021555 Date of Admission: 04.15.94 PCP: Ehlers, Willa Attending: Ward Admitting Resident: Kimberly Ring\nCC: 83 y\/o man w\/ known CAD presenting with near syncope\nHPI: 83 y\/o man w\/ CAD, (no stents), followed by Dr. Youmans, presents after an episode of diaphoresis and upchucking after helping his sister clean out the water in her basement (this happened Saturday am). Of note, he had one episode of diarrhea that morning. He denied any fevers or chills, or nausea or vomiting prior to this episode. When he started vigorously removing the water from the floor, he began feeling lightheaded and nauseated, and was told he was diaphoretic. He sat down on the stairs with assistance from the plumber, and upchucked. After vomiting he still felt dizzy and lightheaded. Ems was called, and upon arrival at the ED, he had another episode of diarrhea. At no point did he have chest pain. He did not lose consciousness. This felt somewhat similar to an episode of near syncope he had in 2092. In general, he is limited in his activity by his osteoarthritis. However, he walks up stairs regularly and gardens without chest pain. The only new medicine change is an increase in his norvasc. He has not been experiencing any palpitations, or shortness of breath. He denies any headache, visual changes, dysuria, abdominal pain, sore throat. He has heard that there is a bug going around, but denies sick contacts. ED Course: Upon presentation to ED, HR 50, BP 141\/62, 18, 99% RA, afebrile. Given aspirin, home meds, beta blocker held for bradycardia. Decided to admit despite negative troponins and no EKG changes because symptoms of dizziness when walking persisted.\nROS: Negative in detail; positives noted in HPI.\nMedical History: 1.

Certainly in someone with known CAD, cardiogenic near-syncope is most concerning, namely, MI, with atypical features. However, his EKG is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain. Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s. However, I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion. It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen. There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story.\nSyncope: Stable, no longer feeling dizzy or nauseated Admit to telemetry and monitor overnight Has completed MI r\/o Continue ASA, beta blocker, (w\/ hold parameters), statin, ACE Has close follow up w\/ Dr. Youmans (next week), and likely does not need repeat stress test while in house CAD: As above, will d\/c on 50 PO Toprol BID per Dr. Youmans recommendations Diabetes: Diet controlled at home RISS while in house with BID fingersticks to assess glucose control Elevated WBC: Likely 2\/2 gastroenteritis.

His cardiovascular issues include prior syncope, nonobstructive coronary disease, and hypertension. In the interval, since our last visit, he has done well from a CV perspective. He has had no episodes of chest pain, pressure, tightness, orthopnea, PND, progressive lower extremity swelling, or claudication. He did unfortunately have an episode of diverticulosis requiring hospitalization at Oakcrest Nursing Home. He did not require transfusion. The bleeding sounds as though it was self-limiting and has not recurred. Otherwise, his health is unchanged.

Longstanding insulin-dependent adult onset diabetes with a history of neuropathy and retinopathy.\n2. History of lower extremity edema with past evaluation per patient including a normal stress echocardiogram.\n3. History of low back pain due to degenerative disc disease. The patient has been treated at the Bryan W Whitfield Memorial Hospital with treatments including facet blocks and epidural injections.\n4. Status post cholecystectomy.\n5. Status post four vaginal deliveries, two cesarean sections and two miscarriages.\n8. Hypothyroidism.\n9. Former smoker approximately 15-pack-year history quit seven years ago.\n10. Hypertension.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a longstanding history of diabetes. She has required retinal laser surgery for retinopathy. She reports some tingling and numbness in the bottom of her feet. She has had debilitating problems with lower extremity swelling over the last 18 months. She notes that an extensive evaluation was initially done without a clear explanation. Her endocrinologist had her stop her Actos which resulted in significant improvement. Over the last six months, however, the patient has developed leg swelling again. She denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She does note some exertional shortness of breath, which she attributes to her weight. She has no history of exertional chest pain. She has not noted a change in her abdominal girth. She has had no calf pain or swelling. She does note a history of sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome. The patient notes that she had a sleep study at some point in the past two or three years ago. A CPAP device was recommended but not tolerated by the patient. She notes that she has significant daily low back pain. Her average pain is 8-9\/10. This occurs while she is standing or walking any distance. She has very little or no pain when she is sitting or lying.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise, unremarkable with no fever, chills, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, black or bloody stools, dysuria, skin rash. The patient does have exertional leg cramps. She notes a vascular evaluation was normal and her pain was felt due to her back.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Norvasc 5 mg q.d, Bextra 20 mg q.d, Lipitor 20 mg q.d, lisinopril 40 mg q.d, atenolol 50 mg q.d, Flonase one spray each nostril q.d, quinine 324 mg q.h.s. p.r.n, aspirin 81 mg q.d, insulin, Humulin N 40 units b.i.d, Humalog sliding scale 15 to 25 units q.a.m. 15 to 25 units before dinner, levothyroxine 150 mcg q.a.m.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Weight 284 pounds, temperature 98.2, heart rate 68, blood pressure 140\/64. The patient is in no distress, breathing comfortably. HEENT: Anicteric, no oral lesions. Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no thyroid mass or nodule. Lungs: Clear to auscultation. No wheeze, rales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Regular. Distant heart sounds. No murmur, rub or gallop. Abdomen: Obese, soft, no mass. Normoactive bowel tones. Extremities: 2+ edema to the knees. Vascular: Carotid pulses are strong and symmetric without bruit. Radial, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are strong and symmetric.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Edema. The patient's edema is likely multifactorial. She does not have evidence of congestive heart failure today. I reviewed her dietary sodium intake, which sounds to be acceptable. She may benefit from additional nutrition counseling regarding this issue. Her leg swelling may also relate to her Norvasc use. I did not see her urine microalbumin testing and laboratory studies the patient brings with her today. Significant proteinuria may be contributing to her edema as well. The patient has had no reactions to sulfa medications and has never been on a thiazide diuretic to her knowledge. I recommended initially that she stop the Norvasc and start hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d. I discussed the use and side effects of this medication. I will see her back in the office in two or three weeks to review her progress.\n2. Low back pain. I recommend the patient continue her Bextra. We discussed other pain medications including narcotics. We elected against using these medications today.\n3. History of sleep apnea. The patient has significant fatigue. This may be due to her sleep apnea. In addition, her difficulty with her weight as well as fluid retention may relate to her poorly controlled sleep apnea. I discussed this with her today. I would recommend that she return for a follow up sleep study. She did not have good luck with a sleep mask but might do better with a nasal mask. She will think about this and we will review it again on her follow up visit.\n\n\n\nRoger York, M.D.\n\n\nDictated By: Roger York\n\n\neScription document:4-6557064 Dana Vaughn\n\n\n\nDD: 08\/27\/60\nDT: 08\/28\/60\nDV: 08\/27\/60\n\n* Record date: 2061-07-15\n\nReason for Visit\nThis is a 65 year old female referred to the diabetes management service for poorly controlled diabetes\n\nChief Complaint\nThis patient is admitted to the hospital for lap gastric banding\n\nHistory of Present Illness\nThe patient has history of Type 2 diabetes.

She comes in today with her husband and daughter. (Her daughter is her legal healthcare proxy.) They come in to follow up on a recent hospitalization at Mid Coast Hospital. In January, she was noted by her family to be agitated and confused. She was missing her medication or taking too much medication at times, including her insulin. She also became paranoid when efforts were made to intervene to assist her. Her family notes that this seemed to begin after her gabapentin dose was increased to 600 mg bid. She was also taking some other drugs at the time that affect the central nervous system, including trazodone, benzodiazepines, and narcotics for back pain. She was admitted to the geriatric psychiatry unit at Mid Coast in January 2065. She stayed there for almost a week. According to the family, some medications were discontinued and donepazil was started. Also, they think she had a brain MRI. She improved and was ultimately discharged. She has done much better since discharge. She went with family to Michigan. They report that there she was much better, playing water volleyball last week. Her husband is now supervising her medications. He still notices some memory loss, but this has improved since her discharge. She has had frequent headaches. She has noted no urinary incontinence and no worsening of her gait.\nAccording to available notes, drugs stopped during her hospitalization include gabapentin, trazodone, metformin, HCTZ, Hunulin, and Lispro. She is back no the metformin and HCTZ.\nHer current medications are: aspirin 81 mg daily, Celebrex, donepazil 5 mg daily, HCTZ, linsinopril, labetalol, Crestor, insulin, pramipexole 0.125 mg qhs, Protonix, Roxicet, L-thyroxine, temazepam qhs, and metformin. She is allergic to erythromycin.\nOn examination today pulse is 60 and regular. BP is 104\/60. She is alert and oriented to time, except the precise date. She is aware that yesterday was Tuesday. She is oriented to place. Her mental and motor responses are slightly slow. She displays an appropriate sense of humor. She attends well. She recites the months of the year promptly forwards and backwards. She registers 4 of 4 words. She recalls 3\/4 at one minutes and the 4th with a semantic clue with a slight error 14 Massachusetts Drive rather than 24 Massachusetts Drive. At 5 minutes, she recalls all 4 with only the error, 14 Massachusetts Drive but with no need for a clue. At 10 minutes, she recalls 2\/4 without any clue, the 3rd with a semantic hint, and the 4th with a semantic hint again as 14 Massachusetts Drive. She readily adds a simple sum in her head. She follows multiple step commands. She copies interlocking pentagons and a 3D cube well with only slight 3D perspective distortion. She constructs a clock well with good planning and no neglect.\nVisual fields are full. Pupils are 2.5 mm and reactive. Fundi are not well visualized. There rest of the cranial nerves are intact. Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal. There are not extrapyramidal features, and there is no paratonia. Reflexes are damp in the arms and absent at the ankles (UE 1\/4, knees 2\/4, ankles 0\/4) and symmetric. Plantar responses are flexor. Romberg is negative. She walks without hesitation in gait initiation. Her stride is reasonably good, Her base is only slightly widened. She tandem walks with moderate unsteadiness.\nThe examination has not changed much from her visit in October 2063. She has some problems with memory by examination, but this seems to have improved greatly since her hospitalization. Her confusion and reported paranoia seem to have gone away. Except or mild psychomotor slowing, she does not have features to suggest NPH as the cause, such as urinary incontinence or magnetic gait. I suspect that her recent deterioration was due to adverse reaction to psychoactive medication that has now been discontinued of limited.\nWe will make no change in medication today. We will request the recent MRI from Mid Coast. She will return in several weeks after we have gotten the MRI.\n\n\n\nUriah Yousif, M.D.\ncc: Roger York, M.D. 454 Prospect Street Sleepy Eye, NC 77659\n\n\n* Record date: 2065-12-19 EDVISIT^60244986^XIAN, BROOKLYN^12\/19\/65^QUAGLIA, BRONSON\nI confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient and\nreviewed the PA's documentation.

Her initial blood pressure, as she walked down the hall, was 154\/71. Repeating this after sitting was 126\/68. Lungs: Clear. Cardiac: Regular. Extremities: Trace edema.\n\nASSESSMENT: Uncontrolled adult onset diabetes. Care for this will be challenging due to the patient's cognitive problems. She does use Valley Hospital Web Services. We discussed to start frequent communication via Web Services of test results will be helpful for me in helping her adjust insulin. We discussed the possibility of changing from NPH to Lantus insulin, but elected to continue her NPH for now. We discussed that her use of the ultra-fast acting insulin does not quite make sense. She is taking an injection in the evening, long after her meal. I asked her to describe her meals and she has carbohydrates essentially with every meal. I think initially she can easily tolerate 10 units of Humalog with each meal. She notes that she prefers to inject the insulin after she eats, which is acceptable as long she does it within a few minutes of the meal. She currently is using an average of 15 units, so this will increase her total daily insulin use by just 15 units. I asked her to check 3 fingersticks a day for me and to e-mail them on a daily basis to start. She will check a fasting fingerstick. She will check a fingerstick before her evening meal, which is her largest meal of the day. She will check a fingerstick 2 hours after her evening meal. She does not need to check a fingerstick right before bed. She will stop using Humalog right before bed and only use the NPH at that time. We discussed the importance of cholesterol treatment. Her last LDL was over 100. I would like to revisit the idea of using a statin. I will repeat her CK level to see if this remains elevated. Her blood pressure on recheck is acceptable. I will see her back in the office in 2 months rather than what is booked now. Most of our visit today took place together with her husband. We spent a total of 25 minutes with more than half the time spent in counseling.\n\n\n\nRoger York, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:6-48975237 TC567\n\n\n\nDD: 02\/12\/67\nDT: 02\/12\/67\nDV: 02\/12\/67\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2076-12-06\n\n\nINTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES\nMESA VISTA HOSPITAL\n\nReason for visit Follow up after recent hospitalization.\n\nHistory of present illness Was admitted to LCMH after an episode of syncope.

She was discharged to johnson rest home on 10\/12\/79. Two hours after arrival, she had a respiratory arrest and was taken to the Intensive Care Unit at Clinica Rovira where she stayed until 11\/03\/79. She is extremely difficult to diurese because of her tenuous renal function, this required multiple adjustments of her medication. Stress test showed no ischemia and echocardiogram showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal chamber size and systolic function, estimated ejection fraction is 65% as well as biatrial enlargement. She did well acutely with BiPAP and remains on oxygen. As part of her workup, she had pulmonary function tests, which showed moderate obstruction without a bronchodilator response and some mild restriction likely due to her obesity. In addition, she was quite anemic with hematocrit of 19 on presentation. There was no evidence of hemolysis. She is mildly iron deficient and colonoscopy showed a tubulovillous adenoma, which was excised as well as a short area of Barrett's esophagus. There was no evidence of active bleeding. She received multiple transfusions throughout her stay and was started on darbepoetin, for what was ultimately felt to be anemia of renal disease. She was discharged to Lahey Clinic and has just returned home. Her son, Brendon Ambrose who was the healthcare proxy, is here with her today.\n\nToday, she feels reasonably well. She is still somewhat weak from the prolonged hospitalization, but is quite enthusiastic about the fact that she lost 30 pounds. She is taking her medications regularly and remains on 2 liters of oxygen. She has no chest pain or shortness of breath. Her diabetes regimen was changed during the hospital, she is still taking 70\/30 insulin, but lower dose in the evenings and using a sliding scale of lispro insulin with meals.\n\nHospital course was complicated by a hospital-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection as well.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure secondary to diastolic dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine approximately 3, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral neuropathy, Barrett's esophagus, colon polyps (tubulovillous adenoma 2079), diverticulosis adenoid hypertrophy, humeral fracture, history of marijuana use, history of alcohol abuse.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Reconciled today, they include:\n1. Aspirin 81 mg daily.\n2. Calcium plus D 1 tablet b.i.d.\n3. Darbepoetin is followed by Dr. Dougherty at St. Mary's.\n4. Iron sulfate 325 mg b.i.d.\n5. Hydralazine 100 mg t.i.d.\n6. Loratadine 10 mg daily.\n7. Metolazone 100 mg daily.\n8. Metoprolol succinate 150 mg daily.\n9. Multivitamin.\n10. Nitroglycerin patch 0.3 mg per hour (3 x 0.1 mg patches).\n11. 70\/30 NovoLog 60 units in the morning and 35 in the evening.\n12. Omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d.\n13. Potassium chloride 40 mEq t.i.d.\n14. Ropinirole 0.25 mg daily.\n15. Simvastatin 40 mg daily.\n16. Spiriva 1 inhalation daily.\n17. Spironolactone 50 mg daily.\n18. Torsemide 100 mg b.i.d.\n19. Trazodone 25 mg nightly.\n20. B-complex vitamin daily.\n21. Vitamin D3 1000 units daily.\n22. Coumadin as monitored by the Hematology Dept.\n\nALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS: None.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure is 136\/60, pulse 74, temperature 97, and weight 222 pounds. General appearance: She looks remarkably well given everything she has gone through. HEENT is unremarkable. Neck is supple. No lymphadenopathy, no JVD. Lungs are clear. Heart irregularly irregular without murmurs. Abdomen is soft, nontender, without organomegaly. Extremities without edema.\n\nLABORATORIES: Drawn by the VNA on 01\/04\/80 shows hematocrit of 28.6, INR 2.1 on December 9, 2079 as well as potassium 3.9 and creatinine 3.2.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n1. Congestive heart failure, diastolic dysfunction. She is currently euvolemic with a weight of 222 pounds. She will check daily weights. I will speak to Dr. Vandiver, her cardiologist whom she is seeing next week about getting her enrolled in the HH Cardiac Rehab Center. Meanwhile, she will call me for any fluctuations in weight.\n2. Atrial fibrillation, stable and rate controlled. Coumadin anticoagulation followed by the HH Hematology Department.\n3. COPD, for now, she remains on Spiriva and Flovent as well as oxygen 2 liters per minute. We will see how she does; she may benefit from a trial of Advair.\n4. Chronic renal insufficiency. Creatinine at baseline of 3.2. She will need to be watched closely. She expressed interest in possibility of her renal transplant should that become necessary. There has been a question as to whether she has renal artery stenosis based on a Doppler ultrasound done during rehabilitation. I think this must have been done at Brookwood Hospital because no studies are available in the HH system. Dr. Dougherty had done MRA a number of years ago, which showed no renal artery stenosis at that time, but her worsening renal function is new. She is scheduled to see Dr. Dougherty next week and will follow up with her expressly raising this issue. Her son brought up the issue of perhaps consolidating all her care at the HH ,in particular is seeing a nephrologist here. She is quite fond of Dr. Dougherty who has cared for her for years, but I think given the complexity of medical care. this might not be a bad idea. She is going to discuss with Dr. Dougherty and I will E-mail Dr. Dougherty as well.\n5. GI. She was noted to have Barrett's esophagus and tubulovillous adenoma on exam and she will need to have followup within 1 year for this.\n6. Heme. Her anemia is a combination of iron deficiency and anemia of renal disease. She needed several transfusions during the hospitalization. She is scheduled to see Hematology at Stone-Wheeling in January. In the meantime, I have spoken to Dr. Dougherty who agrees to monitor her in the Renal Department at St. Mary's. If necessary, they can give her intravenous iron. I will check a hematocrit and iron stores today and fax them over to Dr. Dougherty.\n7. Health care maintenance. Labs today. H1N1 vaccine today. Son, Brendon Ambrose is her healthcare proxy and I have put his name in the Advanced directive file on the LMR. She wishes to be full code at present. I will see her again in 4 weeks.\n\nVisit length 60 minutes.\n\n\n\nWendy P Nowak, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:2-22566361 CSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 12\/12\/79\nDT: 12\/12\/79\nDV: 12\/12\/79\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2091-07-11\nReason for Visit\nComprehensive evaluation of all problems.\n\nProblems\nhypertension\nPRESENT SINCE MID 2060'S.

He has been experiencing increasing dyspnea with exertion over the past 5 weeks. He has especially noted this when he climbs stairs or walking up an incline. He also notes this SOB when he is walking the golf course. He denies any chest pain or orthopnea, although he states that he has been experiencing some indigestion the past few days. It usually occurs in the morning. He was given sublingual nitroglycerin and notes improvement in his symptoms His Lasix dose was increased on 4\/3\/96 (from 80 mg to 120 mg). This increase did help his symptoms a little, but he still felt his exercise capacity had decreased.\n\nAn ECHO was done on 4\/10 which was not significantly changed from 1\/95. His EF was 74%, mild MR, dilated LA, symmetric LV hypertrophy without any obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities and RVSP 43 mmHg.\n\nA Sestamibi stress test was done on 5\/19. The patient exercised for 3 minutes 21 seconds reaching 84% of predicted HR. His EKG had STD AVF, V4-V6. The perfusion scans showed a moderate, reversible mid-distal anterior, septal and apical defect indicative of moderate ischemia. LV function preserved.\n\nHe was admitted electively today for further evaluation. He arrives to Internal Medicine chest pain free and hemodynamically stable.\n\nAllergies\nNKDA\n\nPast Medical History\nHypertension\nHyperlipidemia\nDiabetes Mellitus - since 2070's\nAtrial Fibrillation - for 1 1\/2 yrs- on chronic Coumadin- followed by FWO at VMC\nGout\nLeft Olecranon bursitis\nUmbilical hernia\nBenign Prostatic Hypertrophy- s\/p TURP 3\/86 at VMC (Fonseca)\n\nFamily History\nMother: Died at age 89 - old age\nFather: Died at age 37 with Pneumonia\nSiblings: one brother with DM- s\/p amputation for PVD\n\nSocial History\nMarried- 4 children\nLives with his wife\nRetired claims examiner\n\n\nHabits\nETOH: None\nTobacco: Quit in 2070's - smoked 1 ppd x 30 yrs\nDiet: Poor diet habits\nExercise: Last 5 wks minimal exercise due to DOE- prior to that walked 2 miles, 5x\/week\nCaffeine: 2 cups of coffee\/day\n\nReview of Systems\nNeuro: No recent fever, chills, night sweats, unintentional weight loss\/gain\nNeuro: + Labrinythitis- on Meclizine prn, No lightheadedness pre-syncope or syncope, No HA\/Sz\/CVA, No visual or speech changes\nCardiac: see HPI, denies palpatations\nEndo: + diabetes, no thyroid disease\nResp: see HPI, no SOB at rest, no orthopnea, PND, No COPD\/asthma.\nGI: No constipation.

As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07\/20\/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery. Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure. The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting. After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred. It has been progressive over the last several months. He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux. He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that. He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring.\n\nPast medical history:\nNotable for insulin-dependent diabetes.\nHypertension.\nHypercholesterolemia.\nHyperhomocysteinemia.\nParoxysmal atrial fibrillation.\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy.\nGout.\nRenal insufficiency.\nMild thrombocytopenia.\n\nCurrent Medications:\natenolol 25 mg BID\nCoumadin; Dir: as directed\nEcotrin 325 mg qd\nLipitor 20 mg qd\nLasix 120 mg qd\nfolate 1 mg qd\nallopurinol 100 mg qd\nAtivan\nProscar\nfree text medications; Dir: Insulin\nProtonix\n\nAllergies:\nNo known drug allergy or IV contrast dye.\n\nFamily history:\nPositive for brother who is status post stent placement at the age of 78 and another brother with congestive heart failure. There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family.\n\nSocial history:\nThe patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065. He does not drink alcohol. He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.\n\nReview of systems:\nNegative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain. He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss. He denies hematochezia. He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis. He denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema. He denies dysuria or hematuria. He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.\n\nPhysical examination:\n-Pulse: 55 and regular\n-BP: 160\/80 in the right and left arm in seated position\n-resp. rate: 12 and unlabored\n-Heent: No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag. Mucous membranes are moist. Trachea is midline\n-Neck: Thyroid is not palpable. Carotids are 2+ without bruits. Have a normal upstroke. JVP is less than 7 cm of water\n-Chest: Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes. He does have low dullness in both bases\n-Cardiac: Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum. He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1\/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1\/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur\n-Abdomen: Normal bowel sounds. No organomegaly. No pulsatile masses\n-Extremities: Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric. He has no pedal edema. He has no clubbing or cyanosis\n\nProcedures:\nTc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on. His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate. Peak blood pressure was 158\/80. He had no chest pain. Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution. The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.\n\nEKG:\ntoday shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.\n\nSelected recent labs:\nLaboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12\/22\/2096 and 12\/26\/2096.\n\nAssessment and plan:\nIn summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096. His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again. There are a number of factors involved here. He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled. I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath. He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura. He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO. He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension. He also has low platelets. The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia. It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation. He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time. Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile. He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well. My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this. He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done. I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization. I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia. Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization. Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address.\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\natenolol 25 mg BID\nCoumadin as directed\nEcotrin 325 mg qd\nLipitor 20 mg qd\nLasix 120 mg qd\nfolate 1 mg qd\nallopurinol 100 mg qd\nAtivan\nProscar\nfree text medications Insulin\nProtonix\n\nThank you very much for referring this very pleasant gentleman to Wayne Dental Clinic for evaluation and management of coronary disease, mitral regurgitation, PFO, atrial fibrillation, and congestive failure.\n\nBest personal regards.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\nHenry Mays MD, PhD\n\nSigned electronically by Henry Mays MD, PhD on Jan 6, 2097\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2083-09-22\nChief Complaint\nMrs Chapman is here to follow up on Back pain, HTN, S\/P TAH and DM\n\nHistory of Present Illness\nFor the past 21 days has had back pain since she was involved in a low speed MVA.

We increased his 70\/30 insulin from 30 to 35U BID last month. He has been keeping track of sugars at least BID since then. He still has the majority of sugars in the low 200 range, some in the 300's, a few in the 100's. Interestingly, his fasting sugars are for the most part higher than his daytime sugars. He has not been adhering to a good diabetes diet - he enjoys a blueberry muffin from RR Donnelley daily. His daughter-in-law who is also my patient has told me that he eats anything he wants and all the wrong things. I addressed this issue w\/ Mr. Oshea. He says he tries, but he enjoys these things and feels he doesn't have much else in life to enjoy. He is worried about his remaining vision. He was told by Dr. Villagomez that the pressure in his L eye was unusually high. She wants to see him back again this month for another exam and wants him to bring his eye drops. He also is having trouble sleeping. He never had a great sleep pattern since he worked as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and was up at all hours. He has no trouble falling asleep, but wakes up about 2 a.m. every morning and can't fall back asleep. He does take naps in the afternoon at times.\n\nProblems\nH\/O Cerebrovascular accident : unclear when; pt describes as mild stroke; was started on dipyrimadole at that time by neurologist.\nDiabetes mellitus\nHypertension\nGlaucoma\nVisual impairment : pt legally blind\nRetinopathy : s\/p multiple laser surg; legally blind\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy : followed by Dr. Landers\n\nMedications\nArtificial Tears 2 DROP OS TID\nTRAZODONE 50MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO QHS PRN insomnia\nTimolol Maleate 0.5% 2 DROP OU BID\nInsulin 70\/30 Human 35 UNITS SC BID\nDIPYRIDAMOLE 75MG TABLET take 2 Tablet(s) PO TID\nEnalapril Maleate 20MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO BID x 90 days\nMetoprolol Tartrate 50MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO BID x 90 days\nLipitor (ATORVASTATIN) 10MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO QD\nAmbien (ZOLPIDEM Tartrate) 5 MG (5MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS PRN insomnia\nProscar (FINASTERIDE) 5 MG (5MG TABLET take 1) PO QD\nFlomax (TAMSULOSIN) 0.4 MG (0.4MG CAP.SR 24H take 1) PO QD\n\nAllergies\nNKA\n\nSocial History\nlanguage: English\nliving: w\/ son and his wife; pt's wife passed away; moved here from NY in 12\/2084\nwork: retired Senior Manager of Broadcasting\ntobacco: 2 ppd x 24 yrs; quit age 39\nEtOH: remote hx heavy use; quit age 39\ndrug: none\nsexual: not active\ndomestic violence: neg\n\nReview of Systems\nDenies headache, visual change, confusion, focal weakness or paresthesias; denies chest pain, sob, change in exercise tolerance, pedal edema, orthopnea; denies symptoms of hypoglycemia; does have frequent urination, some urinary incontinence despite meds.\n\nVital Signs\nBLOOD PRESSURE 124\/60\nPULSE 72\nWEIGHT 238 lb\n\nPhysical Exam\nGen: obese man, NAD, appears tired today\nHEENT: PERRL, EOM intact, oral mucosa moist, no lesions\nNeck: supple, no LAN, no masses\nLungs: clear bilat\nCV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no M\/R\/G\nExtrem: no edema; radial and p.t. pulses 2+ bilat\n\nAssessment and Plan\n75 y.o. man w\/ DM type 2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, BPH, legally blind, still w\/ elevated blood sugars.\n1) DM: emphasized to pt the importance of diet in controlling blood sugar; he says he will make an honest attempt to do better; will recheck HbA1c in April; he will continue to monitor blood sugars at home; has appt w\/ Dr. Villagomez of MEDIQUIK this month, is up to date w\/ podiatry.\n\n2) hyperlipidemia: will recheck fasting lipids in April; continue lipitor.\n\n3) HTN: good control today; continue enalapril, metoprolol.\n\n4) BPH: followed by Dr. Landers; has f\/u w\/ him later this year.\n\n5) insomnia: early morning waking difficult to treat w\/ a pill; despite my discussion w\/ pt regarding this, he would like to try Ambien.

Pt lives with daughter-in-law and grandchildren, who were both recently sick and recovering from influenza. The pt began to have a non-productive cough associated with a fever (101o-102o), watery eyes, diaphoresis, and chills early this week after his family was sick. His daughter-in-law states that he has also been increasingly confused during this time period. He has been confusing the time of day (confusing night for daytime and vice versa), increasingly forgetful, and falling more than usual. He has been falling with increasing frequency over the last 3 months. On average, he would fall about once a week. On the day prior to admission, the pt walked to Procter Gamble (2 blocks from house) and fell twice. He was helped back up by by-standers. He describes the fall as his legs giving out from under him, and has been shuffling his gait more than usual recently. During each fall he denies LOC, denies CP, denies, SOB, denies incontinence, and denies head trauma. On the day of presentation, the daughter-in-law reports that the pt fell 13 times and when she could no longer help him rise called EMS.\n\nEW Vital signs: T:98.6o, P:99, BP:174\/65, RR:20, SaO2: 91% on RA\nEW: After the pt presented to the EW, he tested positive for influenza A and was treated supportively.

Reason for visit: A 71-year-old male for comprehensive eval\/management of multiple issues. Problems: 1. Diabetes: Continues on oral agents since 2087. A1C is below 7.0 at goal. No hypoglycemia. Fasting sugars less than 130 on balance. Has regular follow up. 2. Hypertension: Blood pressure well controlled on valsartan. Cardiac ultrasound 2111 with normal ejection fraction, no LVH and normal mitral regurg. Continue current program. 3. Coronary artery disease: Patient had mildly abnormal stress test with moderate posterior ischemia in 2112. This was done due to exertional shortness of breath. Those symptoms have essentially resolved. He has never used nitroglycerin. He has gone through the cardiac rehab program. Now put on beta blocker due to patient's preference. No strong indication given. No MI or symptomatic angina. 4. Hyperlipidemia: Tight control of lipids achieved on Zocor. LDL less than 100. 5. Stroke: Status-post stroke 2111 with slurred speech and left facial droop. Warfarin recommended for one year at that time for presumed cardiac embolus. Considered discontinuing this visit. 6. Anemia: Patient has had a mild hyperproliferative anemia. Has been seen by Dr. Barr. This has remained stable. Bone marrow biopsy nondiagnostic. 7. Hypogonadism: Patient has been evaluated by Dr. Dominique Stokes. Placed on AndroGel 2111. Testosterone levels have improved. Question if that has improved his fatigue and anemia. Review of systems: He does have sleep apnea on CPAP. Has bilateral hearing loss on audiogram. Has some peripheral edema on occasion. Have recommended support stockings. Urinalysis today showed greater than 100 red blood cells and he said this was due to penile trauma from tight shorts. We will repeat this. He did see blood that day. He has never seen it since. He has multiple seborrheic keratoses including on his penis. He will see Field Crest Care Center. Otherwise ROS is negative. Family history: Mother died of cancer in her 80's of unknown primary.

Reason for visit: 73 year old male for evaluation\/management multiple issues. Diabetes: he is on maximal dose of glipizide and Glucophage and A1C has been going up steadily now to 8.0. His sugars vary greatly in the morning from 100 to 174. He hasn't been checking pre dinner. We discussed insulin and he really is quite against it. We will continue discussion open. Asked him to check pre dinner sugars. Coronary disease: patient had a mild posterior ischemia in 2112 on a screening stress test. He is actually having some progressive dyspnea on exertion and a sense of chest tightness with one block. He is a bit of a denier. He hasn't tried nitroglycerin, which I have given him. I suggested he do that. He will have a follow up stress test and we will arrange a cardiology consult. UTI: patient had an E coli UTI 9\/13. He doesn't really have much in terms of other prostate symptoms and no nocturia. He has however, developed urinary urgency again in the last week or two. Will check another culture.

BiPAP\n\n\nReactions to Medicines: None\n\n\nChief Complaint: Shortness of breath which is, in fact, chest tightness\n\nHistory of Present Illness: This 73 year-old hypertensive hyperlipidemic diabetic had a previous stroke on 2\/1\/11 and a recent exercise test that showed extensive ischemia as noted above. He has noted shortness or breath for the last three months. In fact the shortness of breath is exertional chest tightness which comes on with exertion and is relieved by rest. He is sent by Dr. Everhart for consideration for coronary angiogram. On 1\/08\/14 his cholesterol was 165, triglyceride 109, HDL 54 and LDL 89. He does get some lightheadedness if he has a high sugar. He's had no rapid heart action or sudden dizzy spells.\n\nROS:Const.-Negative\nEyes -Negative\nENMT: Bilateral hearing loss\nCV: See above\nRespiratory: Sleep apnea\nGI -. Recent constipation\nGU -Impotence. Urgency and incontinence\nMS - arthritis of both knees and hands. Considering knee replacement\nSkin - Negative\nNeuro -CVA in past. Mild residual left facial drooping and occasional trouble finding words.\nPsych - Depression well controlled on Celexa\nEndocrine - Diabetes\nHeme-No blood problems\nAllergies - No drug allergies and no allergies to dye\n\nPast History: T & A, laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He has no other major illnesses. He does not smoke and drinks about one glass of wine per day.\n\nFamily History: His father died at 83 of a stroke, cancer and diabetes. Mother died at 73 of heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Two sisters are living without diabetes.\n\nSocial History: He a mapping technologist and is actively working. He is divorced and has two children and one grandchild. His significant other works as an optician. She is divorced and has three children and one grandchild.\n\nComplete Cardiovascular Exam:. BP 100 50\/65. His jugular venous pressure is seven and he has no carotid bruits. He has no rales. He has a 1\/6 aortic ejection murmur, a 2\/6 MR murmur at the apex with a normal S2 and no S3. He has no enlargement of the liver and no edema.\n\nEKG: NSR 59, LAE, NSTTWA\n\nAssessment: I agree he clearly needs a coronary angiogram as well as a left ventricular angiogram to assess MR. He should also have a left right heart catheter because of the aortic ejection murmur. In the meantime I will ask into double his isosorbide to 40 mg in the morning and again at 3 p.m. to give him better protection throughout the day. I will ask him to increase his aspirin to 325 mg a day. I will also add fish oil 1000 mg a day which is been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death. Finally we will double his Zocor to 40 mg to try to reach the new goal of an LDL of less than 70. I explained the rationale for proceeding on with the catheterization and the probability that we will find multivessel disease that will not be suitable for PCI but rather for continued medicine or possible surgery. Of course the catheterization will determine that. He should not consider any total knee operation until the cardiac status is clarified.\n\n\nQuentin T.

Craft, M.D.\nNorth Penn Hospital\n169 Tamworth Place\nGarnett, CA 47749\n\nRE: Peter Joshi\nMR #453-39-84-4\n\nDear Dr. Craft:\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Peter Joshi in the Cardiology Clinic on February 24th. Mr. Joshi presents with a complaint\nof dyspnea and oxygen requirement. The patient does relate that\nhe has had breathing problems in the past and in fact, markedly\nworse several years ago. However, with the treatment of his\ncoronary artery disease, he had been doing somewhat better until\nhe underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis. Since that\nsurgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time\nduring which he has required supplemental oxygen. At the same\ntime, the patient is being treated for congestive heart failure\nand in fact, has had a recent increase in his dose of standing\nLasix. The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he\ndid have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician\ndid try to drain, however, unsuccessfully. At the current time,\nMr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is\nable to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several\nmonths ago. In fact, he was told recently that he does not need\nsupplemental oxygen. He denies a chronic cough, although he does\noccasionally have some difficulty swallowing which leads to\ncoughing.\n\nHis past medical history includes diabetes, carotid artery\nstenosis, coronary artery disease with both angioplasty and stent\nplacement, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer,\nhypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and\nupper GI bleed.\n\n\nRE: Peter Joshi\nMR #453-39-84-4 -2- 02\/24\/70\n\nHis medications include aspirin, Lasix, Isordil, Zestril,\nLopressor, simvastatin, Norvasc, Prevacid, a multi vitamin,\npotassium, albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, and insulin.\n\nHe has no known drug allergies. He discontinued cigarette\nsmoking years ago.\n\nOn exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122\/60. His pulse was\n56, afebrile. O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when\nI rechecked it, it was 95%. His weight was 221 lbs. He is in no\nrespiratory distress at rest. His oropharynx had dry mucosa and\na somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space. His neck had no\nenlarged lymph nodes. Chest had diminished breath sounds in the\nleft base with crackles. His right lung was clear. His heart\nwas in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II\/III systolic\nmurmur. His abdomen was protuberant, but benign. His\nextremities are with 1+ pitting edema and no clubbing. Pulmonary\nfunction testing had been performed in December and was repeated\nagain today, which demonstrates that he has a combined\nrestrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect. His current\nvital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of\nDecember. He has no bronchodilator response. I took Mr. Joshi\nfor a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that\nincludes after walking up one flight of stairs.\n\nIn summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely\nmostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning.\nHowever, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on\nmy exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred\nhim to have a decubitus chest film taken. Mr. Joshi had several\nquestions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have\nrecommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly. I do\nnot believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled\ncorticosteroid for this gentleman. I do recommend that he get\ndaily exercise. He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and\nI will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that\nhe may benefit from a pleural effusion. I have also\nconfirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen.\nHis pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced\ndefusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for\nalbuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely\nto have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary\nRE: Peter Joshi\nMR #453-39-84-4 -3- 02\/24\/70\n\nvascular disease. However, we will certainly reassess this after\nhis initial work-up. Thank you for referring this interesting\npatient. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to\ncall.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nJohn Riggs, M.D.\n\/quandt\n\ncc:\nCorrine James, M.D.\nHospital Regional Universitario\/Cardiology\n28 Aberdeen Lane\nEtowah, CA 62884\n\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2070-06-06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 06, 2070\n\n\nLeon Craft, M.D.\nNorth Penn Hospital\n559 Tamworth Place\nGarnett, CA 47749\n\nRE: Peter Joshi\nMRN: 453-39-84-4\n\nDear Dr. Craft:\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic today. This lovely gentleman continues to see\nboth me and Dr. Orlena Knowles. I have discussed this with Dr.\nKnowles and I am certainly comfortable in whatever role you all\nwould need to see me playing in Mr. Joshi's care. He notes that\nhis weight has increased to 212 lb and that he has been followed\nclosely by Dr. Knowles who is adjusting Lasix and potassium\nchloride doses. He has had no shortness of breath at rest. He\nhas noticed no significant change in his lower extremity edema.\nHe has mild orthopnea and no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His\nmedical regimen includes aspirin 325 mg PO q.d, Lasix 80 mg PO\nb.i.d, Isordil 40 mg PO b.i.d, Zestril 40 mg PO b.i.d,\nLopressor 100 mg PO b.i.d, simvastatin 20 mg PO q.d, Norvasc 5\nmg PO b.i.d, Prevacid 20 mg PO q.d, and K-Dur 25 mEq q.d. in\naddition to albuterol, Atrovent, and Serevent.\n\nHis physical exam is notable for a blood pressure of 150\/70 right\nand left arm seated. After rest, this comes down to 135\/70 right\nand left arm seated. His heart rate is 70 and regular.\nRespiratory rate is 10. His room air saturation is 95%. His\nlungs are clear to auscultation, although breath sounds are\nsomewhat distant. Cardiovascular exam is notable for\nnondisplaced PMI and a soft systolic ejection murmur. His\nabdomen is soft and nontender. Extremities are notable for edema\nto his knees bilaterally.\n\nRE: Peter Joshi\nMRN: 453-39-84-4 -2- June 06, 2070\n\nElectrocardiogram is notable for sinus rhythm with an axis of -14\nand normal intervals, no evidence of ischemia or infarction. No\nchange from prior electrocardiograms.\n\nIn summary, Mr. Joshi is currently being treated for ongoing\ncongestive heart failure. His pulmonary evaluation here was\nnotable for a combination of restrictive and obstructive\npulmonary dysfunction. I would certainly concur with continued\ndiuresis with close attention to his potassium, BUN, and\ncreatinine.\n\nIf there are any questions or issues, please give me a call.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nCorrine James-Wagner, M.D.\n\/padgett\n\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2071-02-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 13, 2071\n\n\n\nHeather Hodges, M.D.\nDuluth Clinic-Floodwood\nShanghai, CA\n\nRe: Peter Joshi\nMR #45339844\n\nDear Dr. Hodges:\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Hospital Regional Universitario. This lovely gentleman with ischemic heart disease and\ncongestive heart\nfailure has been followed in our clinic since the time of his carotid\nendarterectomy and cardiac\nprocedure. At the present time, he notes that he has been very minimally\nactive because of the\nflooding. He has had no paroxysms of chest discomfort. He has had no exertional\nneck, chest, arm\nor jaw pain. He has had dyspnea on exertion at greater than 4 METS of\nactivity and he does\nhave mild lower extremity edema.\n\nHis medical regimen includes aspirin, Demadex, isosorbide, Lopressor,\nsimvastatin, Norvasc,\nPrevacid, multivitamins, potassium chloride and insulin.\n\nOn physical examination, his weight is 223 pounds. His blood pressure is\n124\/60 right and left\narm seated. His heart rate is 54 and regular. Respiratory rate is 10.\nThere is a mild increase in\njugular venous pressure. Carotids are without bruits. Lungs are actually\nclear to auscultation\nthroughout. Cardiovascular exam is notable for a systolic ejection murmur\nbut no gallop is\npresent. His abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits.\nExtremities are\nnotable for symmetric pulses somewhat diminished at the level of the\nposterior tibialis and mild\npitting edema to the midshin bilaterally.\n\nHis electrocardiogram is sinus bradycardia with inverted T waves in I and L.\nNo significant\nchange from prior electrocardiograms.\n\nIn summary, Patrick Joshi looks like he is in mild volume overload at the\npresent time. He reports\nthat he has had renal insufficiency in the past. Before adjusting his\nDemadex dosing, I will\nreassess his kidney profile.\n\n\nRe: Peter Joshi\nMR #45339844 -2- February 13, 2071\n\n\nIf there are any other thoughts or questions in the care of this lovely\ngentleman, please feel free\nto give me a call.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nCorrine James-Wagner, M.D.\n\n\/hartman\n\n\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2071-07-30\n\nEDUCARE-FARGO Cardiovascular Division\nCVD ER2\n21 Aberdeen Lane JOSHI, PETER\nEtowah, CA 62884 45339844\n(297) 823-0872 07\/30\/71\n\n\nLeon F Craft, M.D.\n135 Tamworth Place\nGarnett, CA 47749\n\nDear Dr. Craft,\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Division on Tuesday. This lovely gentleman with coronary artery\ndisease requiring previous stenting and mild systolic dysfunction\nnotes that he had to participate in the resuscitation of his son,\nwho remains in the Beechwood ICU last night. Despite this\nintense stress, he has no clear dyspnea on exertion,\npalpitations, lightheadedness, or chest discomfort at the present\ntime. He continues on aspirin, Lasix 60 mg a day, Isordil 40 mg\np.o. t.i.d, Zestril 40 mg a day, Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d,\nsimvastatin 20 mg a day, Norvasc 5 mg p.o. b.i.d, Prevacid,\nmultivitamins, and K-Dur in addition to his insulin.\n\nOn physical exam today, his blood pressure is 180\/75. His heart\nrate is 54 and regular. Respiratory rate is 10. There is no\nincrease in jugular venous pressure. Carotids are without\nbruits.

Pt was found by his wife yesterday to be complaining of severe chest pain and SOB. She called EMS. Upon arrival of EMS, pt was in respiratory distress and bradycardic with a HR in the 20s. He was intubated. He subsequently became puloseless and asystolic and was coded for about 10 minutes with 3 rounds of epinephrine and atropine before he regained his pulse. In the ED, his BP was 230\/120 and he was started on a nitro gtt. He was noted to have blood in his OG tube. CXR showed bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.

CV: BP well controlled today, but in the absence of his wife it is entirely unclear what medications he is taking. We had added imdur at our last visit for BP and antianginal control, and I had suggested re-starting Diltiazem. It is unclear if either of these changes are occurring. I will attempt to call his wife to discuss medication regimen, and we will hold on any changes for now. - F\/u with Dr. Vest - Follow INR - Discuss current cardiac regimen with his wife\n#. Oliguric ESRD: He had been doing well via his AVF but with recent sutures after bleeding they have been using his tunneled HD line, which now remains since 3\/30\/97 unless changed over wire at HD. He is dialyzed at Ochsner Health Center Denham Springs in Pahrump. His Nephrologist is Dr. Frank Marquez, and he is pageable at951-440-0959 (Northwest Hospital).\n#. GI: His LFTs are now normal, and his HCV viral load\/genotype have not been able to be determined. It is possible that he has cleared HCV infection in the past. We will continue to follow HCV viral load and consider referral to GI to discuss treatment if LFTs rise of unclear etiology. His synthetic function is mostly preserved. #. DM2: Again, in the absence of his wife it is difficult to determine his current regimen. Last A1C was 6.0, and with recent evidence we will continue his current regimen. #.

There was initial concern for TB, but she ruled out for pulmonary tb with 3 negative smears. PPD positive.\nShe had an MRI of her spine that was initially read as L5\/S1 diskitis\/osteomyelitis with right paraspinal phlegmon.

She has been taking Prednisone 9 mg a day for a long time but has not f\/u with Rheum for about a year. She did have a cortisone in the L shoulder in the past. She is able to lift her arms over her head.\n2. Depression: Her family feels that she is doing much better on the Effexor than the Celexa. The pt has seen Dr. Ramsey in Psych a few months ago.\n3. Dementia: Dr. Ramsey recommended continuing on the Aricept. Overall, the pt's family feels that her memory is worsening, although some days are better than others. She has not had any other episodes of halluncination, as was described in an email from her son a couple weeks ago. The pt states that she is sleeping and eating well, but her family thinks that she sleeps too much.\n4. Eyelid surgery: She is scheduled to have surgery on her eyelids on May 25. The drooping of the lids is so bad by the end of the day that she is unable to read.\n5. Incontinence: She has now had 3 collagen implants for her bladder. The pt does not think that she is any better, but when Dr. Xuereb tested her a few months ago, she saw some improvement.\n6. Diarrhea: She has about 2 soft BM's a day, but she also has intermittent diarrhea. Her daughter-in-law is wondering if the pt might be lactose intolerant. She is not having any blood in her stool. She does not have any diarrhea in the middle of the night. She has never gotten a colonoscopy since the last attempt just prior to her hospitalization 2 years ago.\n7. DM: The pt states that she does not eat much sugar, but her daughter-in-law thinks that she probably does consume a fair number of sweets.\n8. Hyperlipidemia: She has been on Zocor 20 mg QD but is not following a low fat diet.\n9. Medication compliance: The pt's family is not sure if she is taking her medications every day. They pay a private nurse to come lay out the meds in the am, but the pt is often asleep when she comes and will not get up to take the meds at that time.\n10. Onychomycosis: The pt has a fungal infection in her great toes. Her daughter-in-law is wondering if there is anything topical to treat this with.

Discussed keeping pt stimulated with outings, family visits. Her excessive sleeping is likely a combination of several factors, including her multiple medications, depression, and possibly the dementia.\n4. Eyelid surgery: Pre-op exam today. Will order complete metabolic panel, CBC, and EKG.\n5. Incontinence: It is not likely that she will be able to have any more procedures at this point. Some of the incontinence may be secondary to dementia rather than pure stress incontinence.\n6.

Briefly, the\npatient is a 71-year-old female with several cardiovascular risk\nfactors. She was admitted to the hospital in January after a\nprolonged episode of palpitations. The patient had a tiny\nTroponin elevation to 0.3, and the decision was made to manage\nher conservatively. The patient continues to have these episodes\nof palpitations, but she does not get chest pain with any\nexercise.\n\nHer current medical regimen includes aspirin, beta-blocker,\nstatin and an ACE Inhibitor.\n\nOn physical examination she has 2+ carotids, which have normal\nupstrokes and no bruits. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. Her\nheart examination reveals a regular rate with a normal S1 and S2,\nwithout S3 and S4.\n\nHer electrocardiogram is normal.\n\nAssessment: I concur with Dr. Zapien in that we will increase the\npatient's beta-blockers to decrease her probable supraventricular\ntachycardia. She will be seen back here in several months.\n\n\n\nVasilios C.

She was hospitalized for acute MI last December and is being followed by cardiology. Since her last follow-up the patient has had no episodes of exertional or rest chest pain, no DOE or SOB. She was visiting her relatives in Oregon this month and did have one episode of SVT in setting of viral URI. Experienced sudden onset of palpitations with discomfort, lasted 30 minutes without chest pain, lightheadedness or diaphoresis and then resolved spontaneously. She has had no further episodes. She has been compliant with her medications over the last few months and has not experienced any side effects; however, when asked directly, has had 2 or 3 episodes of lightheadedness in morning with abrupt position changes, nothing long-lasting and no near syncope.\nPt reports blood sugars by finger stick at home of 100-140s generally.

As you know, she is a very pleasant 72-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, active tobacco use, there is probable coronary disease, with preserved left ventricular function (EF 60% on echo), as well as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. She last saw me in clinic in 03\/2077, and missed several followup appointments in part because she spends much of her time in Oregon. Over the past year and several months, Ms. Quinley has been doing quite well. She states that she has episodes of palpitations approximately every 2 months, lasting less then 5 minutes. She notes a sensation of fluttering in her chest, with no chest tightness, no dyspnea, no lightheadedness, no syncope. She denies PND, orthopnea, or angina. Unfortunately, Ms. Quinley continues to smoke, but is actively interested in quitting. She states that she is planning to enroll in the Stonybrook Smoking Cessation Program.\nHer current medications include enteric-coated Aspirin 325 mg q.d, atenolol 100 mg q.d, lisinopril 20 mg q.d, Lipitor 20 mg q.h.s, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d, Micronase, fluocinolone, Protonix, and Allegra.\nOn examination, she is well appearing today in no distress. Blood pressure is 128\/60 mmHg in the right arm, and pulse is 65 beats per minute. Extremities are warm, with no peripheral edema. Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally with no bruits. JVP is 8 cm of water. Chest is clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. PMI is nondisplaced, with a normal S1, physiologically split S2, soft S4, no murmurs, no rubs. Abdomen is soft with no masses or hepatomegaly. Pulse examination is normal.\nRecent lipid profile from 03\/2078 reveals a LDL of 150.\nECG today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per minute, PR interval 154, QRS duration 78, QT interval 442, QTC 467, and QRS axis 33 degrees. There is a nonspecific Q-wave abnormality, and prolonged QT, with no significant change compared to prior.\nIn summary, Ms. Quinley is doing quite well. Her palpitations and likely SVT are occuring at a frequency that Ms. Quinley feels are quite acceptable for her. Therefore, she wishes no consideration of possible interventions or changes in her medical regimen. She has no symptoms to suggest current coronary ischemia. Regarding her cardiovascular risk factors, her blood pressure is reasonably well controlled today, and you are actively managing her diabetes. However, her lipid profile demonstrates an elevated LDL. Therefore, I have taken liberty of increasing her Lipitor to 40 mg q.h.s.\nI plan to see Ms. Quinley in followup in approximately 6 months. Please feel free to contact me otherwise regarding her cardiovascular issues. Thank you very much for referring this very pleasant woman for cardiovascular care.\nMs. Quinley was seen, examined, and discussed with our clinic preceptor, Dr. Queen Frank-Newman.\n\n\nUriel Patrick Zapien, MD\nDictated By: Uriel Patrick Zapien\neScription document:1-8289950 AFFocus\n\nDD: 10\/05\/78 DT: 10\/05\/78 DV: 10\/05\/78\n\n* Record date: 2082-04-29\nVital Signs AGE 76y2.3m BLOOD PRESSURE 128\/70 WEIGHT 217 lb O2 sat 97%\n76 year old patient presents for the following: follow-up of DM, hypertension Also presents for Physical examination and screening pelvic and pap test denies thirst, nocturia denies pelvic pain, vaginal itch, discharge. no postmenopausal bleeding continues to smoke, changed brands in order to help her eventually stop or cut down has a cough, postnasal drip. uses loratadine but not using nasal inhaler Medications: per list Allergy: NKA Habits: walks for exercise. eats some vegetables most days. denies ETOH\/illicit substance use. takes multivits and calcium denies safety concerns\nROS - denies weight change, fevers, chills, sweats denies rash or skin lesion denies headache, sensory disturbance, muscle weakness denies depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance denies GI distress, change in appetite or bowel habits denies joint pain, swelling denies urinary discomfort\/frequency denies CP\/SOB\/PND\/orthopnea\/change in exercise tolerance denies wheezing PE VS as noted NAD alert and oriented x 3 skin - no rash or lesion discs sharp, normal vascular caliber OU swelling beneath both eyes - inverted eye lids TMs intact AU no sinus tenderness no oral lesion, no pharyngeal inflammation or exudate no thyroid enlargement or tenderness no cervical\/ax\/ing lymphadenopathy chest clear to ausc RR 12 cardiac normal s1\/s2 no m\/s3\/s4 HR 70 reg breasts no mass\/tend\/discharge performs BSE regularly abd no mass\/tend\/organomegaly BS+ throughout pelvic: vulva\/vagina - normal mucosa, no discharge\/ulceration normal urinary meatus cervix - no motion tenderness or discharge.

She was en route to her normal dialysis session, and EMT took BP that was 80s\/40s, brought to LCH ED for evaluation. Notably recently admitted to Santa Rosa on 9\/10\/2098 for hematemesis\/hematochezia, but no intervention done. No report of recent GI bleeding.\n\nIn ED, initial BP in 80s\/30s, got 1.5 liters of IV fluid, came up to 90s\/50s. Also was on 4-5 liters of oxygen with sat 95%. Blood and urine cultures sent, Vancomycin and Cefepime given. Daughter was contacted, who states patient is definitely DNR\/DNI and no invasive interventions are to be done (including central lines, surgery, etc.) Bedside ultrasounds revealed known pleural effusions, pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, and hypoechoic material in bladder suspicious for abscess\/infection. CT abdomen done, was notable for bladder wall thickening potentially c\/w cystitis, a new moderate sized pericardial effusion, and rectal wall thickening c\/w proctitis. After CT, Foley placed with reported return of 400-500 cc of frank pus. Labs notable for K 5.0, BUN\/Cr 39\/4.02, WBC count 7.7.\n\nPatient seen in ED &#8211; BP 80s\/40s, but arousable and able to answer simple questions.

Thickened urinary bladder wall with irregularity and enhancement\nconsistent with cystitis.\n4. Slight increase in moderate ascites since 4\/2\/98.\n5. Distended urinary bladder with unchanged bladder wall thickening.\n\nAlso noted are moderate bilateral pleural effusions.\n\nCXR:\nIMPRESSION:\nPulmonary edema with large left effusion small right effusion.\n\nTTE:\nMITRAL VALVE\nThere is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus. There is no evidence\nof mitral valve prolapse. There is trace mitral regurgitation by color and\nspectral Doppler. There is a calcified papillary muscle tip.\n\nLEFT ATRIUM\nThe left atrium is elongated. The antero-posterior left atrial dimension is 38\nmm (normal range: up to 38 mm). The medial-lateral left atrial dimension is 42\nmm (normal range: up to 49 mm). The superior-inferior left atrial dimension is\n56 mm (normal range: up to 53 mm).\n\nAORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT\nMultiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis. The aortic\nvalve is tricuspid. There is evidence of mild aortic insufficiency by color\nand spectral Doppler. The aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is 29 mm\n(normal: less than 40mm). The ascending aorta diameter above the sinotubular\njunction is 28 mm (normal: less than or equal to 36mm).\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE\nThe left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular systolic\nfunction is within normal limits. There is symmetric left ventricular\nhypertrophy. There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.

CONSULTATION REPLY Thank you for sending this patient for neurologic consultation. I have reviewed or collected the primary data and examined the patient personally. CHIEF COMPLAINT: 62 year-old left handed white male (crossed right handed for writing), with bilateral buttock burning dysesthesias radiating down both lateral lower extremities. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year-old man with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, diabetic neuropathy and obesity who developed two years of gradually progressive discomfort in the lower extremities. He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg. If he shifts to his right leg, he gets a similar discomfort one or two minutes later. This is relieved by sitting. It will happen when walking as well. This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy. He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls. Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The past medical history is as above and also includes a superficial varicosity in the right mid calf. ALLERGIES: Sulfa, contrast medium, Ambien. FAMILY HISTORY: Non-contributory. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Hytrin, Cozaar 50 mg q. day, Ritalin 20 mg five times per day, glucophage 10 mg t.i.d, Rezulin 400 mg t.i.d, Neurontin 600 mg q.h.s. and Selexa. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is getting divorced and has four grown children all in good health. BIRTH HISTORY: He was born with hammer toes and no other family member has this condition. EDUCATION: He is a Consultant who works in Dupont. SOCIAL HISTORY: He has limited exercise and diet. He has 30+ year history of cigarette smoking and has has no cigarettes in the last six weeks. He denies alcohol use or recent recreational drug use. He has no HIV risk factors. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: System review reveals normal bowel function with frequent small volume urination. He attributes this to his Ritalin use and has not seen a urologist. He has difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and had only minimal improvement with Viagra. When walking he develops some symptoms of claudication which were immediately relieved by resting. There is no cardiovascular, respiratory or constitutional symptoms. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: healthy appearance with a blood pressure of 175\/90 in the left arm seated. Pulse of 60 and regular. Carotids 2+ without bruits. Mental status: Unremarkable. Cranial nerves: immature cataract, o.s. No evidence of retinopathy. Motor: normal tone and full strength in upper limbs. Mild 5-\/5 weakness in ankle extension bilaterally. Mild distal atrophy in the foot intrinsics. Rapid alternating movements intact. Sensation: decreased to vibration and joint position in the feet bilaterally. Mild decrease to pin over the medial nerve distribution on the right hand. The muscle stretch reflexes are absent at the Achilles and 1+ at the patellar, brachial radialis, biceps and triceps with flexor, plantar responses. Finger to nose is accurate in both arms. Gait is steady but distorted by the knee injury and slightly wide based. He has a decreased tandem but can heel walk. He has minimal unsteadiness in the Romberg position. DATA REVIEW: MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine was performed at Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy and then again several days later at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point (860-721-0108). Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal. The summary report from Bayonet Point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and I await faxed copy of that report. ASSESSMENT: 1. Neuropathy. The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain. He did undergo an evaluation by Dr. Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort. He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy. There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy. I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors. I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief. He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications. I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging. Thank you for sending him to my office, it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree. The risks and benefits of any recommended or alternative treatments were discussed. DIAGNOSTIC CODE\/LEVEL: C5\/peripheral neuropathy.

Huynh, MD\nSouth Side Hospital\nThoracic Surgery\n92 Cleveland Street\nMorris, MO 95412\n\nRE: Otis Narvaez\nMR #04561326\n\nDear Dr. Huynh:\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Oscar Narvaez in\nconsultation. As you know he is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history\nof diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Recently, he underwent\nevaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent\ndobutamine stress echocardiography. The echocardiogram revealed reduced\nleft ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent.\nThere was no evidence of ischemia. He subsequently underwent coronary\ncatheterization. I do not have those results, but he claims that he was\ntold that he had no arterial blockages. Symptomatically, he is\nsignificantly short of breath with minimal exertion. He has attributed\nthis to his weight. He was started on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic,\nalthough he has not been taking either of these medications. Prior to\nhis catheterization a chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the left\nupper lobe of the lung that was not present in 2067. This was confirmed\nsubsequently on CT scan, suggesting that this was most likely a primary\nlung malignancy. He is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with\nyou.\n\nHis past medical history is remarkable for diabetes, hypertension, low\nback pain, and obesity.\n\nCurrent medications include glucophage 1000 mg po q.d, Ritalin 80 mg po\nq.d, Celexa 10 mg po q.d, Neurontin. No drug allergies\n\nFamily history is remarkable for heart disease in his father.\n\nSocial history: he works as a consultant in the Morris area. He smoked for\n40 years but quit approximately three years ago. He drinks rarely,\nalthough drank heavily in the past.\n\nRE: Otis Narvaez\nMR #04561326 -2-\n\nDecember 30, 2072\n\nReview of systems is remarkable for shortness of breath. He denies\ngastrointestinal complaints.\n\nOn physical exam he is obese but well appearing with a blood pressure of\n140\/70 and a pulse of 80 and regular. HEENT is unremarkable, neck\nsupple without thyromegaly, no jugular venous distention, carotids full\nwithout bruits, chest clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam:\nregular rate and rhythm, PMI nondisplaced, normal heart sounds, no\nmurmurs or rubs. Abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or\nCVA tenderness. No clubbing cyanosis or edema. Pulses full.\n\nImpression: Mr. Narvaez has evidence of decreased left ventricular\nfunction by echocardiogram. By report he has no evidence of coronary\nartery disease, although I have not seen this report myself. If indeed\nit is true that he has no coronary artery disease, then my guess is that\nthis represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to\nhis diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse. In any case, this\nputs them at increased risk for an operation, although probably less so\nthan if he had significant coronary disease. I see no reason why you\nshould not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately. Prior\nto his operation, he should be placed on ACE inhibitor and diuretic.\nI'll be happy to continue to see him should he care to transfer his care\nto South Side Hospital.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\nKevin Y.

He denied chest pain, but did admit to a tight feeling down his left arm on occasion. This was not associated with activity. He admits to being a very sedentary person.\nThe results of his Adenosine MIBI were abnormal, with abnormal myocardial perfusion, global LV function, and CT coronary angiography. There were no significant findings on the clinical evaluation. The response was non-ischemic, and there were no EKG changes during infusion. The results revealed a small calcified plaque in the proximal LAD coronary artery without flow- limiting stenosis. There was a more heavily calcified plaque visualized in the distal RCA which was flow-limiting, and there was a moderate amount of stress-induced ischemia on imaging. There was severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 32%. The narrowing in the distal segment of the RCA was greater than 70%.\nA lipid profile performed following his office visit on February 19, 2077 revealed a total cholesterol of 182 mg\/dl, an HDL of 43 mg\/dl, an LDL of 71 mg\/dl, and a triglyceride level of 342 mg\/dl. He has not been on any cholesterol-lowering medications.\nHe had undergone previous cardiac catheterization in November 2072, which demonstrated insignificant coronary artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 63%.\nSince his last office visit, he continues to be significantly short of breath with any activity. He denies any chest pain or left arm discomfort.\nHis current medications include Ritalin 20 mg five times daily, Ambien 10 mg at hour of sleep, Neurontin 900 mg three times daily, Lasix 20 mg every other day, Lisinopril 60 mg once daily, Otis Narvaez MR #045-61-32-6 Page 2 March 12, 2077 aspirin 325 mg with Oxycodone as needed. He usually takes these once every other day. He is now on 20 units of an insulin preparation that he cannot identify. He takes this at bedtime.\nReview of systems reveals that he has chronic peripheral neuropathy in his feet. This causes him to feel imbalanced, and it is necessary for him to walk with a cane.\nHe was diagnosed with diabetes in 2068 and hypertension in 2067. He also has chronic low back pain due to degenerative joint disease, as well as lumbar disc disease. He also has degenerative joint disease in his knees. He receives psychiatric follow-up for his diagnosis of depression.\nHe underwent a gastric bypass procedure at Harmon Medical Rehabilitation Hospital in 2068.\nOn January 20, 2073, he underwent a left lingular-sparing upper lobectomy for a T1 squamous cell carcinoma.\nOn physical examination, he appears healthy, albeit overweight, with a normal affect. His weight is 208 lbs, the heart rate is 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate is 16 per minute, and the blood pressure is 140\/62 mm\/Hg. Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat reveals upper dentures in place. There is no jugular vein distention, and the lungs are clear. There is increased AP diameter with bilateral gynecomastia. On cardiac examination, the heart sounds are distant, and there is a regular rhythm, a normal S1, a single S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The lower extremity examination reveals a 2 cm tender superficial area on the distal right calf. There is no edema noted.\nI discussed with Otis Narvaez and his wife, Santiago, my recommendations for a cardiac catheterization followed by stent placement, as indicated. He has agreed to this, and Dr. Yaziel Kraft will perform the procedure. His office will call Mr. Narvaez to schedule the catheterization. After leaving the office today, he will have a CBC, a PT, a PTT, and a comprehensive metabolic profile performed. He will return to see me in the office again in one month.\nBest personal regards.\nSincerely,\nKenneth Z. Sellers, M.D. \/huff\nCharlene B. Bates, RN, BSN Scribe for Kenneth Z.

On 8\/01\/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time. The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal\/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied. Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. On 8\/10\/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing: marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma. Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement. Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease. On 8\/10\/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction. This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space. The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread. There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung. PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer. The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.\n\nHe remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss and minimal symptoms when he chews his food well.\n\n\nProblems\/PMH:\nRepair of Zenker's diverticulum in 2080\nAterial stent was placed in the mid LAD in 4\/80\nHypercholesteremia\nArthritis\nBorderline Diabetic\nHeart murmur for 50 years\n\nFH\/SH:\nNever married\nNo children\nNever smoked\nRare ETOH- 6 beers per year\nAerospace engineer for 40 years\nNo family history of cancer\nHere with sister.\n\n\nReview of Systems:\n\nGeneral: 20 lb weight loss, fatigue, no fevers, no chills, can't eat as much, fills up quickly\nRespiratory: No cough, no SOB, no DOE, no hemoptysis, no wheezing\nHEENT: No neck swelling, occasional (R) neck stiffness, no hoarseness, no hearing loss\nCardiac: No chest pain, no palpitations( heart murmur for 50 yrs.) arrythmias, no valve disease\nGastrointestinal: No nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no constipation, no bleeding\nNeurologic: No seizures, no headache, no weakness, no numbness\/tingling\nLymph nodes: No enlarged lymph nodes\nMusculoskeletal: No back pain, no neck pain, no leg pain, no arm pain\nUrologic: No hematuria, no dysuria, or no obstruction\nEndocrine: No adrenal, no thyroid or no parathyroid disease\nHematologic: No bruising, no clotting, no bleeding\n\nMedications:\nAtenolol 50 mg QD\nTriamterene\/HCTZ 50\/25 QD\nVitamin B Complex 100 u QD\nFolic Acid 1 mg QD\nIron Sulfate 1 tab BID\nLipitor 10 mg QHS\nTerazosin 5 mg QD\nLisinopril 2.5 mg QHS\nDucolax 2 tabs QD\n\nAllergies:\nCodeine-dizzy\n\nPhysical Examination:\n\nVSS AF\nPS=1\nNeck: no nodes palpable\nHEENT: No thrush or mucositis; EOMI; PERRL\nSkin: no rash\nExt: without edema, clubbing\nCor: S1 S2\nChest: clear lungs without wheezing or crackles\nAbdomen: soft, NT no HSM\nNodes: neg cerv, sc\nNeuro: grossly non-focal\n\nData (laboratory and radiographs)\n\nsee above\n\nAssessment and Plan:\n\n72 year old man with Stage IVB metastatic esophageal cancer. He is doing quite well. Given the fairly asymptomatic nature of his cancer we have opted to start with radiation first, as his primary mass is fungating in nature and there has been evidence of blood loss. After radiation is completed in 3-4 weeks, I will see him for consideration of chemotherapy but only after re-staging. If he remains asymptomatic and there has been little progression of disease, we may opt to observe him closely without treatment. If the scans show significant progression or he becomes symptomatic, then we will start systemic treatment soon afterwards. He is not a surgical candidate given his stage of disease and lack of symptoms.\n\nRTC in 5 weeks to assess symptoms and to arrange restaging scans.\n\n\nXavier Otero, M.D.\n\ncc:\n\nDr. Geno Guidry\nDr. Gregory Mcguire\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2084-01-07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellow\/NP\nXiang\n\n\nReason for Visit:\ntaxotere weekly chemo\n\nDiagnosis\/Treatment Summary:\nStage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass)\ns\/p XRT to esophagus\nRenal vein thrombus on Coumadin\n\nHistory: Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6\/83.

Past medical records.\n\nHistory of Present Illness\n\nMr. Vollmer is a pleasant 73-year-old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma s\/p XRT and chemotherapy, CAD s\/p LAD stent placement, and borderline DM who presents to the Health Care Center complaining of 48-hour history of dizziness and subjective fevers. He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he awoke in the morning with a severe headache. As he got out of bed, he felt extremely lightheaded. He describes the dizziness as internal, and not like the room was spinning. He laid down, with some resolution of the symptoms. Of note, he reports that the dizziness is less severe when he lies down and comes on with standing or sitting up. Throughout the day, he developed a cough productive of green sputum, a subjective fever, continued headache, and nausea without vomiting. He denied any chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or pain upon deep breathing. That evening, two nights prior to admission, he developed night sweats but had no rigors. He continued to feel similarly throughout the day prior to admission, and presented to the emergency room for further evaluation.\n\nThe current presentation is in the context of increasingly poor PO intake secondary to chemotherapy and treatment for esophageal cancer. He reports a four-to-five month history of poor appetite, eating chicken soup. He denies any trouble swallowing solids or liquids. Of note, the day prior to the onset of symptoms, he was NPO for a restaging CT scan. He reports eating two scrambled eggs after the scan, and a chicken potpie for dinner the night prior to symptoms starting.\n\nIn the emergency room, vitals were temperature of 95.6, pulse 52, blood pressure 132\/68, RR=20, 95% on room air. He received Zofran 4 mg IV once, levofloxacin 500 mg PO once, and a NS 500 cc bolus. CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions.\n\nOncology History (per attending notes)\nPatient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6\/83. On 8\/01\/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time. The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal\/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.

Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement. Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease. On 8\/10\/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction. This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space. The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread. There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung. PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer. The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate. 3\/14\/84 Restaging work-up revealed progressive disease (see imaging below).\n\nHis last Taxotere treatment was February 17; further treatment was stopped secondary to a chemotherapy burn on the right arm.\n\nPast Medical History:\n\n1.

Pneumonia: The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness, subjective fevers, and productive cough of green sputum. Physical exam reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, right greater than left. The constellation of symptoms can be attributed to the pneumonia found on chest imaging. The possible causes of the pneumonia include aspiration, infectious, and post-obstructive causes. The patient reports no problems with swallowing and has not vomited, making aspiration pneumonia lower on the differential. The chest CT does not show any evidence of tumor obstruction around the bronchi. Further, the pneumonia and pleural effusions are bilateral, meaning that the obstruction would have to be higher in the bronchial tree, making obstruction less likely. In this case the most likely cause is infectious in nature; the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, H. influenza, Staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as Legionella sp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes. Based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent.\na. Start Levofloxacin 750 mg daily for antibacterial coverage.\nb. Sputum gram stain and culture\nc. Blood cultures\nd. Pneumococcus antigen screening\ne. U\/A, urine Legionella\nf. NS at 75 cc\/hour. If PO intake is not increased, will switch fluids to D5 NS.\ng. Tylenol for fever, Zofran for nausea.\nh. Incentive spirometry every two hours while awake.\n2. Dizziness: The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness. Potential causes include orthostatic causes secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or poor sympthathetic tone; anxiety; cardiac causes (dysrhythmias, CAD), anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypoglycemia). This patient has a history of CAD, but EKG findings and cardiac enzymes do not suggest cardiac insult. The patient has not had an increase in the BUN or creatinine from baseline, making dehydration less likely. Labs did not show any electrolyte abnormalities; therefore hypoglycemia is low on the differential diagnosis. The dizziness was positional in nature. The patient reports long-standing poor PO intake, particularly because he was NPO for much of the day prior to the start of symptoms.

Briefly, the patient is a 73 year-old male with h\/o esophageal CA (Stage 4B), DM, HTN, CAD s\/p LAD stent, renal v. thrombosis on Coumadin. He presents today with 2 days of malaise, nausea, and dizziness, which he states does not consist of room spinning but that he does feel off-balance and is associated with nausea. His PO intake has been decreased due to nausea. Has has had a cough productive of green sputum, and CXR evidence of bibasilar consolidations and decreased breath sounds on exam R > L. He was admitted to medicine for treatment of PNA in the setting of multiple comorbidities, and for lightheadedness on standing which is likely orthostatic.\n\nWill treat with Levofloxacin 750 PO QD to cover CAP. Send legionella urinary Agn, and sputum cx (blood cx sent in ED). Check orthostatics. IVF gentle hydration. Need to clarify goal INR in setting of Coumadin use for renal vein thrombosis. Microcytic anemia-will check anemia labs; already on iron supplementation. EKG and 1 set of cardiac enzymes do not suggest an acute cardiac event. Will treat nausea symptomatically.

Other complaints include a HA every morning which is global and tends to improve over the course of the day with tylenol. He does admit to some visual changes that have been occuring for about one year--transient decreased vision in right eye, lasting for several minutes to hours and happening about twice per week. He saw an ophthamologist in 12\/02 who, per the patient, found no abnormalities. He also states that he has had nonproductive cough with chest congestion for about 2 weeks. No fevers, chills, n\/v or diarrhea. Some rhinorrhea but no sinus sxs. He has had difficulty with muscle cramps since his BMT which respond well to gatorade.

I hadn't seen him since last year. I'm very pleased to see how well he's done. He has had no double vision, no staggering, and no numbness around the mouth. His speech is a little slurred he says (unchanged). He walks with a wide-based gait, but is otherwise steady on his feet. There is no tremor. His arms and legs are strong. Extraocular movements are full. The pupils are equal. There is no ptosis. His speech is fluent.\n\nHe takes one aspirin a day as well Lipitor and some vitamins (the other medicines he doesn't recall but I think you are in the know about).\n\nHis blood pressure is 120\/80. The pulse is around 76. There are no cervical bruits.\n\nFrom my perspective he is doing well on the aspirin and we should sit tight. I would like to see him again in a year and at that time we should have our Dopplers again to recheck the flow in the basilar artery. The right vertebral is dominant and the left is occluded. The left MCA stem was hard to visualize on the imaging. It may well be occluded with collateralization. The left imaging was in 2082. He is stable at this time. He knows to call if he develops any symptoms.\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nG. Kevin Yawn, M.D.\n\n\n* Record date: 2087-03-01\nPatient here for f\/u COPD.

He states that since beginning the Flomax that we started him on in January, his symptoms are at least 50% better. He is only getting up once per night to go to the bathroom and is not having any hesitancy or difficulty passing his urine. He is also following up on his elevated cholesterol, his hypertension. He states that he has been trying to follow a better diet, but does state that he has not been particularly good about getting regular exercise. He is also following up on his diabetes. He is not having any difficulty with his medications. He did not schedule his colonoscopy that I had referred him for in January but states that he would be willing to do so after the spring. He is also following up on his COPD. He states that he has been using the Pulmicort and the Spiriva as well as the Serevent Diskus on a daily basis. He states that his breathing has been good. He is hardly wheezing at all and he has better exercise tolerance than before. He is also noted to have hepatitis C as well as fatty liver. A recent ultrasound also demonstrated gallstones. He does not have any postprandial symptoms of right upper quadrant pain, nausea or vomiting. He does question whether or not he is a candidate for treatment of hepatitis C.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for B-cell lymphoma, pontine stroke, basilar artery stent, herpes zoster, graft versus host disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, Pseudomonas pneumonia, COPD, diabetes, heart murmur, BPH and hepatitis C as well as gallstones and fatty liver.\nMEDICATIONS: Serevent Diskus, metformin, folate, Flomax, Spiriva, albuterol, Lopressor, Combivent, Pulmicort, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, magnesium and aspirin.\nALLERGIES: He has an allergy to ACE inhibitors, dapsone, ganciclovir, sulfa, and Bactrim.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure is 140\/90, on repeat 148\/90, pulse is 64, temperature 97.1 and weight is 259 pounds. In general, he is in no acute distress. The HEENT exam demonstrates no icterus and no injection. The oropharynx is clear. Neck is supple. There is no lymphadenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes and no rales. Heart is regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops. The abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. The extremities show no edema.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July. He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time. He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam. 2. BPH. We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms. Fortunately they are responding quite well to this. 3. Hypertension. This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month. If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this. 4. COPD. Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen. He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible. 5. Elevated cholesterol. His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues. If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests. 6. Abnormal liver function tests. These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver. It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C. For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology. Follow up with me is in one month.\nGrace Knapp, M.D.\n\n\neScription document:1-5138285 CSSten Tel\n\nDD: 04\/23\/88 DT: 04\/23\/88 DV: 04\/19\/88\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2094-09-02\n\n\n\nNAME: Espinal, Sandra\nMRN: 4718200\n\nMEDICATIONS: Per LMR.\nMedications\nPrilosec (OMEPRAZOLE) 20MG, 1 Capsule(s) PO BID\nClonazepam 0.5MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO BID x 30 day(s) PRN prn anxiety, up to bid\nBromfed-pd BLANK take 1 cap po q 12 hours prn\nProzac (FLUOXETINE Hcl) 20MG, 2 Capsule(s) PO QD\nGlucovance (GLYBURIDE\/METFORMIN) 2.5-500MG, 2 Tablet(s) PO BID\nCozaar (LOSARTAN) 50MG, 2 Tablet(s) PO QD\nVioxx (ROFECOXIB) 25MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO bid x 15 day(s)\nNorflex (ORPHENADRINE Citrate) 100MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO Q12H\n\n\n\nS: (1) Patient here complaining of increased neck pain with paresthesias of her\nleft arm and tingling of her third and fourth left fingers.

The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Franklin Feliciano.\nRuath Doss is a 58yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures. She was last seen here March 4th, at which time she was having difficulty tasting food. This finding was not replicated on clinical exam, and her exam was otherwise unremarkable; it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet. Less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide. Otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures.\nMrs. Doss continues to do well. She reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste. She continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization. Via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a NSTEMI during her last hospitalization. She has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results. Finally, she informs me that an appointment with Dr. Yuhas of Neurosurgery has been scheduled for August in order to follow up an incidental small L A2 aneurysm.\nMrs. Doss continues to take Plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has G6PD deficiency). Her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning. However, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke. She continues to tolerate her Dilantin well; there had been a question in April about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6. She denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting. She reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving.\nShe denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production. She does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat. She sometimes feels as though she has creepy crawly things in my head, a sensation similar to when she had a Mohs procedure.\n\n\nMeds: atenolol 50mg po qday Lipitor 80mg po qday Clopidogrel 75mg po qday Glipizide 5mg po qday Cozaar 100mg po qday Metformin 500mg po bid Dilantin 200mg qam \/ 300mg qpm Valtrex prn Acyclovir ointment\nPhysical Examination:\nMS: Alert, appropriately interactive, normal affect.

She is overall doing very well, and has been very meticulous with her healthcare after her hospitalizations in December. We discussed the very small risk of stroke if Plavix is held for a dental procedure. The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel. If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge. However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control. Mrs. Doss was still nervous about suspending the Plavix; ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action.\nMrs. Doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose Lipitor and dietary changes. Her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated. I have also written her a letter certifying that, as of July 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of Dilantin. She emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the Emergency Department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes. If she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication.\nAlthough the incidentally noted L A2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on CTA, I have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with Neurosurgery, as I do not see the date noted in the computer. Finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular R ICA plaque has not progressed. Of note, Dr. Franklin Feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan. Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient. I will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYasmine Florence-Gagnon, MD Educare-Pullman Neurology\n\n\n* Record date: 2090-09-25\nEDVISIT^49535763^DOSS, RUATH^09\/25\/90^GILMORE, RACHEL\nThe patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Xiang.\nResident's note was reviewed.

Thirty\nminutes later, she noticed a similar sensation in her right hand\nfor a few seconds and then resolved completely, and then she\nnoticed it in her right foot and the toes. She wiggles her toes\nin her shoe and then that resolved after a few seconds and then\n30 minutes after that she had a similar but less severe sensation\nin the fingertips of her left hand at about 10:45 that then\nresolved completely. Since then, she has had no sensation like\nthis. She has had pins and needles feeling in her hands and feet\nin the past, but never a sharp thumbtack feeling like this in the\npast. She had no dysarthria, confusion, weakness, numbness\ntrauma, dizziness, loss of consciousness, syncope, seizure\nactivity, changes in her medications, or any new medications.\nShe took her Plavix as usual this morning, is now symptom free,\nand very well appearing. She called her doctor's office and the\nnurse told her to come to the Emergency Department to be checked.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol,\nseizures in the setting of a stroke in 12\/2089, and a left MCA\nstroke in 12\/2089. She has had no seizures since then. She has\nresidual right lower extremity weakness, which is now much\nimproved. Echo in 12\/2089 showed an EF of 60%. She has\nconcentric LVH, no wall motion abnormalities, and no other\nsurgeries.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Past smoker of 30 pack years, ETOH none, and no\nIV drug use. She works as a Business Services Manager and lives\nwith her family.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise, negative.\nMEDICATIONS: She takes Dilantin, glipizide, Glucophage, Plavix,\natenolol, Cozaar, and Lipitor.\nALLERGIES: None.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is afebrile with normal and stable\nvital signs. Awake, alert, and in no distress. Her exam is\ncompletely unremarkable including 5\/5 strength in her upper and\nlower extremities. Gait is normal. She has no cerebellar signs,\npast pointing dysmetria, aphasia, ataxia, focal weakness, or any\nfocal sensory deficit at all.\nLABORATORY DATA: EKG shows bradycardia at 50 beats a minute with\nnonspecific T-wave changes. Fingerstick is 150. Dilantin level\nis normal. Head CT shows no evidence of bleeding or any other\nabnormality.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: Neurology was consulted and agrees\nwith the diagnosis of likely peripheral neuropathy. They will\nhelp arrange followup within 1 week for this patient with her\nneurologist and she is told to see her primary care physician\nwithin 2 weeks and to return to the Emergency Department for any\nchest pain, shortness of breath, or any other worsening of her\nsymptoms.\nDISPOSITION: She is well appearing at the time of discharge in\nsatisfactory condition.\n\nGILMORE, RACHEL M.D.\nD: 09\/25\/90\nT: 09\/25\/90\nDictated By: GILMORE, RACHEL\neScription document:1-9359833 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2092-05-09\nYasmine Florence-Gagnon, MD\nResident in Neurology\nBrookwood Nursing Home\n05 Mason Street\nWilliston, CO 36887\n\n\nXenia Rivas, NP\nSaint Olaf Hospital\n703 Mechanic Street\nCharlotte, CO 22812\n\n\nMay 9th, 2092\n\n\nDear Nurse Rivas,\n\nWe had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures. The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro.\n\n\nRuath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures. She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin. She was last seen here in December 2091. Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy. Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful. However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.\n\nMrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area. She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved. She denies any recent seizures. After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.\n\n\nMedications:\natenolol 50mg qday\nhctz 12.5mg qday\nLipitor 80mg qday\nclopidogrel 75mg qday (not on asa 2\/2 G6PD deficiency)\ncitalopram 40mg qday\nglipizide 5mg qday\nCozaar 100mg qday\nMetformin 500mg bid\nDilantin 200mg bid\nColace\nCalcium, folate\nPercocet 5\/325, 1\/2 tab prn, takes very infrequently\nValium 5-10mg prn, takes very rarely\nLoratadine 10mg prn\nIbuprofen 1 tab qday\nTrazodone 150mg qhs prn, takes rarely\n\nPhysical Examination:\n\nno carotid bruits\n\nMS: Alert, appropriately interactive, normal affect.

Able to walk on heels and toes. Tandem gait intact. Romberg negative.\n\n\nAssessment and Recommendations:\n\n60yo RHF h\/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures. Her clinical examination remains intact. She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin. Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation. Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability. Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study. If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days). After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG. She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.\n\nWe discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention. The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well. (It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.) Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression. Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.\n\nOf note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.

A code was called when bystanders and\nmedics reported she was on the floor, diaphoretic and clammy. The\npatient drank something and then proceeded to be taken to the\nEmergency Department.\nThe patient had a cystoscopy planned for today. She took her\nmedication for her diabetes and presented here with weakness,\nnausea, diaphoresis and felt like she may have passed out. Her\nother complaint was mild back pain from passing out. No epigastric\npain or tenderness and no chest pain. The patient never had any\nchest pain prior to her event. She is followed by the United Medical Center East and their input is pending at this point.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a past medical history\nsignificant for diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and\nmigraines.\nMEDICATIONS: The patient's current medications include Plavix,\nCalan slow release and Glucophage.\nALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to intravenous pyelogram dye,\nPercocet, penicillin, cephalosporin and lisinopril.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: HEENT: Examination is normal. LUNGS:\nClear bilaterally. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm with no\nmurmurs. ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender. EXTREMITIES: Normal.\nGENERAL: The patient looks well and has no complaints here.\nLABORATORY EVALUATION: Finger stick in the Emergency Department\nwas 160. Electrocardiogram shows some PR depressions in multiple\nleads. No significant ST elevations.\nTHERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: Impression is this patient is a 68\nyear old female with planned cystoscopy today who passed out on the\npremises. A code was called overhead. Bystanders reported that\nthe patient was diaphoretic. They gave her something to drink.\nHer blood sugar here was within normal limits. The patient has no\ncomplaints of chest pain or shortness of breath. She looks well\nbut does have PR depressions on electrocardiogram but has no rubs\nor gallops on her electrocardiogram. The patient was made NPO\nbecause of her cystoscopy procedure.\nFINAL DIAGNOSES:\n1. Syncopal episode versus presyncope from the taking of her\ndiabetes medicine this morning.\n2. PR depression on electrocardiogram which appears to be new. No\nold electrocardiogram to compare. We need to address the PR\ndepressions. This is possibly pericarditis but it is unlikely. I\nwould think that this more likely ischemia than pericarditis.\n3. Cardiac ischemia.\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): The patient will\nneed admission and a formal rule out. She may even need an\nechocardiogram inpatient. A full work up is pending.

At that time, she c\/o dizziness, nausea, and her bp reportedly decreased to 60\/40. As per pt s family, she initially refused to go to the ED but in the car on the way home became increasingly confused, dizzy, and nauseas and was brought to Rafael Mount ED.\nFive weeks ago prior to her hospital admission - pt s family reports that during a vacation pt had one episode of seizure like activity for which she was seen in Massachusetts and declared stable and released and a second unwitnessed collapse in alaska where she was brought to a hospital in Anchorage and treated for dehydration. Upon return from vacation, and daughter recalls that she had cough and cold sxs at the time, c\/o increasing weakness, backpain, and fevers. During the same time, the patient reports that she was being weaned off her seizure medications and other medications that might adversely affect her LFTs secondary to LFT elevation on laboratory exams.\nAt present, pt. c\/o severe(10\/10) upper back pain and mid-sternal CP (8\/10) that seems fixed to her back pain improved with pain medications and worse with movement. She reports that she is short of breath all the time and has been coughing a thick mucous.\nHospital Course: MRSA Bacteremia: Blood cultures at San Rafael Hospital grew S. aureus and pt. was started on IV vancomycin. The bacteremic source remains unclear. TTE on 8\/01\/02 showed an EF of 60-65%, no evidence of endocarditis reported. A TEE on 8\/7\/02 visualezed all the valves and no vegetations were seen. Her R. knee was tapped on 8\/8\/02 and cultures were negative. A bone scan on 7\/7\/02 showed a metastatic lesion on MRI in the lower thoracic region and focal increased uptake in the lateral tibial plateau o f R. knee. Back pain: Pt. c\/o moderately severe back pain throughout hospital stay at MSRH. Thoracic spine xrays on 7\/31\/02 showed osteopenia with no acute fracture or subluxation. An MRI of thoracic spin (8\/02\/02) showed a marrow replacing process in the L. T10 pedicle and another smaller lesion at the L. inferior aspect of T11. The lesion was suspicious for metastatic disease. No epidural extension was noted. There was a patent spinal canal and lack of impingement on the thoracic cord. Pt. received dilaudid 1-3 mg q4hours prn back pain. As per psych notes, she did not wish to change medications to methadone or fentanyl. A CT guided bx of the thoracic spine took place on 8\/15\/02 and was non-diagnostic. A neurosurgery consult reported that an open bx might destabilize her given the locationo f the pedicle and recommended that the biopsy be done at GCH. A repeat MRI was done on 8\/20\/02 due to increasing c\/o back pain and showed a 50% compression fx of T4, persitent abnl marrow signal in L. pedicle of T11, and overall heterogenous marrow signal pattern throughout the visualized vertebral bodies. Immunoelectrophoresis was ordered to r\/o myeloma. Right Breast Mass: A firm R. breast mass was noted at the 7 o\/clock position of R. breast at site of lumpectomy scar and the thickening was thought to be 2\/2 to previous sx by surgeous at OSH. A mammogram on 8\/5\/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts. The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified. An u\/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass. A biopsy was delayed 2\/2 to bacteremia. Renal failure: Pt. developed renal failure while on vancomycin with an increase of cr from 1.1 to 2.4. Her vancomycin level was noted to be >60 on 8\/13\/02 and vanco was discontinued. Repeat blood cultures were negative for S. aureus. Anemia: On admission to Rafael Hospital, Hb\/Hct: 11.6\/35.5. She was started on procrit by hematology. She was transfused on unit of PRBCs in the hospital. TIA: Pt. has a hx of TIAs with one episode while hospitalized significant for difficulty with speech and R. hand tingling. An MRI that day showed new increased signal w\/in the ventricles and subarachnoid space noted diffusely. This finding was likely due to prior IV contrast administration of gadolinium, though an underlying hemorrhage or infection could not be excluded. A brain MRI on 8\/18\/02 showed resolution of abnl signal w\/in the ventricles, decrease in high signal in the subarachnoid space, likely representing resolution of sequelae from prior IV gadolinium. No findings of meningitis but persisting increased signal w\/in the L. lope, which may represent vitreal hemorrhage. HTN: Pt. required adjustments in her meciations during her hospital stay to control hypertension.\nMEDICAL HISTORY Recurrent syncope: 2086-2100, 3-4 events per year, last event prior to hospitalization Seizure disorder: first sz in 2090s with unresponsive, staring, mouth movements; often occurred in clusters once a year, last sz prior to admission.

Found to have a MRSA bacteremia with an unidentified source, lesions at T10\/T11 on spinal MRI, and continued c\/o back pain and nausea.\nBack pain: MRI of T spine with abnl and prior percutaneous bx non-diagnostic. Differential dx includes metastatic disease vs. infection. Neurosurgery consulted at San Rafael who felt it to be a high risk procedure and tx here for further mngmt.

Her Lipitor had been held as had her Actos due to elevated LFT's, and her Depakote had been discontinued by her neurologist. Her LFT's had come down from her hospitalization in March but were still elevated at AST 87 and ALT 124. Liver biopsy was being considered by Dr. Yamasaki, her gastroenterologist. She also had been recently hospitalized at San Rafael for syncope with history of partial seizure disorder vs TIA with history of transient episodes of right arm numbness and weakness dating to 2098 but with no seizures in 3 yrs.\n\nIn July O2 she had several episodes of syncope, one of which occured in her neurologist's office. She was apparently hypotensive and initially refused to go to the ED, but later her family brought her to the ED at San Rafael. She was found to be bacteremic with MRSA and was treated with IV vancomycin. Endovascular sources were found to be negative as source, as was a knee tap, and no source was ever identified. She was transferred to GCH in August. She had severe back pain and two bone biopsies were negative for osteomyelitis in the spine. She was also found to have a 50% compression fracture of T4 and this was treated at GCH with a T4 vertebroplasty in September 10. She also was worked up for mets to spine but only benign hemangiomas were found.\n\nShe was discharged to rehab in mid September. She required at least two more admissions from rehab to San Rafael over the next two months. She apparently had severe gastroparesis and was unable to eat, requiring portacath for TPN around October 10. She had then gone back to rehab again but was readmitted with DVT of the left Subclavian vein around the site of the Portacath. She was started on Coumadin and was back in rehab for another few weeks. The arm swelling quickly resolved. There was also reportedly a TIA which occured after an MRI scan with right facial droop and slurred speech at SRH. She was finally discharged to home on November 21st.\n\nMEDS: Coumadin 7.5 mg qd, Norvasc 10 mg qd, Isordil 20 mg tid, Neurontin 300 mg po bid, Plavix 75 mg po qd, Prilosec 20 mg qd, Folic aid 1 mg qd, Synthroid 50 mcg qd, Labetolol 200 mg bid, Glipizide 2.5 mg po qd, Albuterol inhaler prn, erytab 250 bid, Ultram 50 mg q 6hrs prn, MVI, Vitamin B12 1000.

Throughout her hospitalization she lost a lot of weight down from 160's to 170's last spring to current level of 135 lbs. Insulin was stopped and just recently Glipizide 2.5 mg added on. Recent Hg A1C obtained after this visit on 12\/04\/02 was 6.0. Bun \/Cr was 11\/0.9. glucose 196. Cholesterol 225\/68\/135. LFT's were not done and need to be done, will be ordered next lab draw. If normalized then will add back Lipitor. History of gastroparesis, on new med has replaced Reglan, doing better.\n\n2) Hypertension. Doing well on Norvasc 10, Labetolol 200 bid and Isordil 20 tid.\n\n3) S\/p recent upper extremity DVT, on coumadin. Per Dr. Herbert Paris's note of 12\/02, she needs 3 months of anticoag, and then 1mg\/day until the portacath discontinued. With history 2 prior DVT's will need to discuss whether she should be on long term therapy. She is now getting FS INR's thru the VNA, but will be transitioned to Internal Medicine, with access thru the portacath, or continued FS's. INR has been in good range with 7.5 mg coumadin.\n\n4) S\/P compression fracture of T4, s\/p vertebroplasty with successful resolution of the pain. Has other compression fractures but not interested in further procedures at this time.\n\n5) History of hypothyroidism. Had recent labs at SRH on 12\/04\/02 with TSH of 1.3 and Free T4 of 0.9.\n\n6) History of anemia, requiring Procrit and? transfusions during her hospitalizations, with normal hct of 41.1 on 12\/04\/02.\n\n7) Neuro; History of partial seizures, TIA's. Followed by Dr. Gary Keyes. History of silent cerebellar brain infarction on MRI. History of moderate intracranial carotid stenosis, with recent? TIA left hemisphere? repeat carotid noninvasives per Dr. Keyes vs CT angiogram. On Plavix and coumadin. Per Dr. Keyes coumadin alone would be enough for stroke prophylaxis, and he would defer to Dr. Barry as to whether to continue Plavix.\n\n8) History of elevated LFT's. May have been medication related, due to Lipitor, Actos, Depakote. Now off all meds, need redo as above, and consideration if normal of retrial of statin.\n\n\n* Record date: 2103-07-29\nInternal Medicine Admission Note\nPATIENT: Grace Marvin Yandell MRN: 8099832 ADMIT DATE: 7\/28\/03 ATTENDING: WINTERS PCP: Dr. Patricia Mcfarland (MEDIQUIK) 127-319-4834 CONTACT: Daughter: Penelope Yandell 761-259-5716 Code status: Full Source:\nCC: Syncope\nHPI: Ms. Yandell is a delightful 81 year old female with an extensive PMH including HTN, Sz d\/o vs TIAs, dyslipidemia, breast cancer, and DVTs who presents following a syncopal episode on the day of admission.\nPer a note from her neurologist, Dr. Gary Keyes, Ms. Yandell has a history of transient neurologic events, consisting of right hand numbness and weakness, in 2098 and 2099. She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures. She was started on Depakote for this. Between March and April of 2102 her Depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures. EEG in January 2102 showed no evidence of epileptiform activity. In July 2102 she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope. Dr. Keyes witnessed one of these events in his office in 7\/02 and it was associated with hypotension.\nMs. Yandell s family describes her syncopal events differently, stating that she will stare into space for 5-8 minutes, during which time she is unresponsive. When she wakes up, she is confused and sleepy for ~ 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting. These episodes are associated with jaw-clenching, but no tonic-clonic movements. Ms. Yandell does state that she feels dizzy and lightheaded before these events, and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy. She does not recall the events herself. The family does not report loss of bowel or bladder incontinence, although the patient did apparently lose continence of bowel shortly after being admitted (unclear circumstances surrounding this). The family reports that EMS checked her blood sugar on the scene it was normal.\nIn the emergency department, Ms. Yandell s was afebrile, 82 158\/70 18 95% on 2L. She received zofran for nausea, ASA, and IVF, and was transferred up to the floor for further management.\nThe patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position. Do not occur when bearing down, or when she is exerting herself. The episodes are not sudden she appears to have some warning before one occurs. She denies fevers\/chills. No chest pain, palpitations. Some shortness of breath when walking, which sounds like it is unchanged. Has had a cough for a few months and it is occasionally productive of ?color mucus. She takes antihypertensive medications, but takes them as directed and by report does not group them together.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension 2. History of supraventricular tachycardia 3.

Prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of tiny lung nodules seen.\nMRI 9\/02 Findings: Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute ischemia. There is susceptibility artifact in the region of the right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr hole or craniotomy. There are chronic appearing, small right cerebellar infarcts. There are scattered periventricular FLAIR and T2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent with small vessel ischemic change. There is FLAIR hyperintensity in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal, bilateral parietal and left occipital lobes. No abnormal enhancement is seen. The brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are otherwise unremarkable. The major intracranial flow voids are normal. There is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. There is partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells. There are bilateral lens implants. The bones, soft tissues and orbits are otherwise unremarkable. MRA: There is signal dropout in the P2 segment of the right posterior cerbral artery. There is diffuse irregularity of the proximal left posterior cerebral artery. There is moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery. The distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized. There is otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of the circle of Willis. Impression: Flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior predominance as described. This could represent hemorrhage, high protein content, high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium injection. Signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery, consistent with severe stenosis with clot not excluded. Diffuse irregularity of the left posterior cerebral artery. These findings could be secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but vasculitis is another possibility. Moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery. No acute ischemia or mass lesion identified. Chronic right cerebellar infarction. Small vessel ischemic changes.\nCarotid US 3\/02 IMPRESSIONS: 1. RIGHT PROXIMAL CCA STENOSIS. 2. MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION. 3. MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE LEFT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION. 4. BILATERAL ANTEGRADE VERTEBRAL ARTERY FLOW.\nEcho 01 1. Normal cavity sizes, wall thicknesses and global and regional right ventricular and left ventricular systolic function. Left ventricular ejection fraction is in the range of 60%. There is no flattening of the interventricular septum, asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure. There is a reduced mitral valve diastolic Doppler E\/A ratio, which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation. 2. There is fibrosis of the mitral annulus (very mild) and of the interannular fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root. There are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may represent atherosclerotic change. 3. The aortic valve is trileaflet. Cannot fully exclude the possibility of some thickening of the bases of the aortic valve, but, alternatively, the increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent atherosclerotic change of the aorta. There is no evident aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency. Very mild mitral annular fibrosis. Otherwise, the mitral valve appears structurally normal. Normal appearing tricuspid and pulmonary leaflets. There are signals of trace mitral regurgitation and trace tricuspid regurgitation. Flow velocity could not be optimally assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure. 4. There is no evident pericardial effusion.\nASSESSMENT & PLAN:\n1) Syncope : Unclear etiology. History from family sounds much more like seizure.

Her other respirtory-related symtpoms include orthopnea and intermittent wheezing with seasonal allergies. She has no chest pain, PND or LE edema.\nHer work-up to date has revealed a mixed restrictive and (mild) obstructive ventilatory deficit which was attributed to kyphosis and radiation fibrosis + asthma respectively.

There was not a significantresponse to inhaled bronchodilator. The reduced FVC is consistent with arestrictive deficit. Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated. Since6\/03\/04, the FEV1 and FVC have not changed.\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: DOE is likely multifactorial. It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary limitatio from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio-pulmonary exercise test to the patient, to which she agreed. In addition, as previously discussed, she would benefit from pulmonary rehab. Finally, I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture. There was no response to brnonchodialtor today and the patient does not feel any help from it either. I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it doesn't help her. I've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the possiblity of allergic asthma. We will not do the methacholine challange testing due to patient's already deacreased FEV1 (due to restriction) as it might be dangerous to precipitate bronchoconstriciton in the setting of an already limited reserve.\nSeen and d\/w Dr. Weller\n\n\nXavier U.

Approximately\nfour weeks ago, he started noting visual changes. He saw colored\nspots floating in his visual field. He has been noting some\ndecreased depth perception and visual acuity. At the same time,\nhe has been getting throbbing unilateral headaches, which he\nbelieves were migraines. He saw an ophthalmologist at Mediquik who told him that his eye exam was within normal limits.\nHe was then referred to Dr. Gill for neurologic evaluation.\nDr. Gill did not note any significant neurologic deficits.\nHowever, during his workup, he did check a hemoglobin A1c, which\ncame back at 10.2. Of note, the last time I saw the patient, I\nhad sent him a letter stating that his glucose was slightly\nelevated and asking him to return for a fasting glucose. He\nnever returned for that testing.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,\nobesity, and gout.\n\nMEDICATIONS: HCTZ 50 mg p.o. q.d, Atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d,\nallopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d.\n\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Negative for diabetes but positive for kidney\nfailure. This is thought to be due to glomerulonephritis.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He is a Graphic Arts Technician in Oconto. He is\ncurrently on a leave of absence from work. He is a nonsmoker.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He believes that he has lost some weight over\nthe past four weeks but cannot quantify the amount. He has been\nnoting anxiety symptoms, increased urinary frequency, and\nnocturia. Otherwise, constitutional, HEENT, cardiac,\nrespiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and\ndermatologic are negative.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In general, he is a pleasant obese white\nman in no acute distress. Vitals: Blood pressure 134\/90, pulse\n66 and regular, and weight 249 pounds. HEENT: PERRL, EOMI,\nanicteric sclerae. Clear oropharynx with dry mucous membranes.\nNeck is supple with no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly. Chest:\nCTA&P bilaterally. Heart: RRR, no MRG. Abdomen: Obese, soft,\nNT\/ND, NABS, no HSM. Extremities: No CCE. Neuro: A&O x 3, 2+\nDTRs bilaterally.\n\nLABORATORY DATA: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 73 beats per\nminute, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T-wave changes.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Diabetes. The patient was advised that his laboratory\ntesting and symptoms are all consistent with adult-onset\ndiabetes. Given the severity of his symptoms, I have elected to\nstart him on metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d. Use and side effects\nwere reviewed. He will have Chem-7, urinary microalbumin and\nfasting lipid profile checked today. Unfortunately, he was not\nactually fasting. He will also be referred to Gretchen Drew and\nBertha Ely for further diabetic and nutritional education.\nHe will be started on lisinopril instead of HCTZ. He is asked\nto return in six weeks for follow up of his blood pressure. He\nwas advised that his visual changes are likely due to lens\nswelling due to the uncontrolled diabetes. I assume that this\nwill resolve as the blood sugars come under better control. He\nwas given a written note regarding leave of absence from his job\nuntil his symptoms clear.\n2. Migraines. The patient does sound as if he is also having\nmigraines. We will address this at future visits.\n\n\n\nPatti O.

Per pt and her son, for the past few wks pt has been feeling tired, with some minimal weight gain and ankle swelling. Approximately 7-10 days prior to admission, pt given azithromycin for increased cough and COPD. In addition, 8 days prior to admission, pt's regular lasix dose was increased from 80 to 120 mg for four days, then reduced back to 80 mg. On the night prior to admission, pt was in the kitchen, leaning on the counter top, feeling hot and tired when as she was turning to walk back to bed, she began to fall back. Her son, who was in the room, was able to catch her before she actually fell. He reports that she seemed awake but was not responding. There was no sz like activity, no bowel or urinary incontinence. Pt was out for approx 30-45 seconds when she came to. She does not remember going down. She denies any auras before going down, no chest pain, no palpitations, no increased SOB. No recent fevers, abdom pain or diarrhea. Her son called EMT and she was brought in to PHH.\n\nED Course: initial vitals 140\/66 78 18 98.0.

She had a mitral valve replacement with the St. Jude's valve and septal myomectomy in 2085. Because of thrombosis of the valve with recurrent heart failure, she had a redo mitral valve replacement complicated by sinus arrest and AV nodal block requiring a permanent pacemaker. She also had several episodes of syncope, once after taking an additional dose of Lasix and another in the setting of over diuresis. Repeat echo showed that her AS was not critical and she had significant LV outflow tract obstruction.\n\nOther medical problems include severe COPD, trigeminal neuralgia, ruled out for temporal arteritis by several biopsies, R hip osteonecrosis, and bone spur of the right shoulder. Mrs. Mitchell is S\/P total hip replacement surgery, and had her rehab atNorth Mountain Hospital. She had intercurrent admissions for overdiuresis and for flash pulmonary edema with over- and under-diuresis, respectively. She currently takes Bumex 6 mg po bid, and with this, her weight has been 140-145 pounds, which is her target weight. Her BUN and Cr are in the 25-40\/1.3-1.7 range.\n\nSince her last visit, she has done well at home. Her breathing at home is intermittently difficult, especially if she rushes. However, oximetry shows that she is in the mid 90's at rest, and that she drops down to high 80's to 90 with exertion. She has had GI evaluation for anemia in the past, only revealing diverticulosis; her Hct was 28 recently, and Dr. Conway arranged for her to udnergo transfusion of one unit of PRBC. She feels more energetic after this. She takes Fe sulfate, but has some constipation from this.\n\nShe may require ENT surgery for vocal cord growth by Dr. Cherry. This is being considered in consultation with her LMD Dr. Evelyn Conway, and her pulmonologist Dr. Geoffrey Lucas.\n\nMedications (Confirmed):\n\nAdvair 500\/50mcg spray inh bid\nAmbien 5 mg po qhs\nBumex 4 mg po bid\nColace 100 mg po tid\nFosamax 70mg po qwk\nLescol 40mg po qhs\nmetoprolol 100 mg po tid\nMiraLax 17 g 2 po qhs\nNexium 40mg po qd\nPaxil 10mg po qd\nPlavix 75mg po qd\nSpiriva 18mcg\/capsule inh qd\nverapamil hydrochloride, SR (extended release) 120mg SR po qd\nZyrtec 10mg po qd\n\nAllergies:\nPenicillin allergy angioedema\nAllergic drug reaction percodan, bactrim, pseudophed, leading to angioedema\nHeparin induced thrombocytopenia HIT\n\nFamily history:\nnegative for CAD\n\nSocial history:\nson Bobby (retired Secondary School Teacher) now lives with her\nsister lives on Chipley (near Eagle Pass)\ngod-daughter Bethany lives nearby\n\n\nReview of systems:\nall systems reviewed. except as noted above, noncontributory.\n\nPhysical examination:\n-BMI: 27.1 Overweight, moderate risk\n-Pulse: 60\n-resp. rate: 12\n-height: 61 in.\n-weight: 143 lbs.\n-General appearance: No acute distress.\n-Skin: No rashes, anicteric.\n-Heent: EOM full, PERRL\n-Neck: Carotids 2+ with bruits greater on right than left.

He brings in his blood sugar values with him today. These are improved since his last visit, and somewhat more believable ranging from 128 to 195, predominantly higher in the evenings more than the mornings ranging from 150 to 190. He is currently on a somewhat odd regime of 6 units of insulin regular twice a day, with a large 24 units of insulin at night, and 14 units insulin in the morning. He has not had any further hypoglycemic attacks, is having no nocturnal awakening, and seems to be sticking more to the diet. He has however gained some weight, which is a little disconcerting. He does attend a podiatrist and is doing well from that perspective. He is to return to the ophthalmologist for further diabetic screening later on in the year. He missed his last nutrition appointment and is not interested in further follow-up with nutrition at this time. 2. Cardiovascular. He is on atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperglyceridemia, atenolol 25 mg, and aspirin. Further question regarding his stroke back in 2061 shows that this presents with confusional episode with unsteadiness, resolving after approximately 36 hours, and he was found to have a hole in his heart at that time. He was eventually stopped off Coumadin in 2063, but had a recurrent episode at that time and he was put on Coumadin for life at that point. He had an aborted myocardial infarction in 2067. He has had no chest pain in the interim, has good exercise tolerance with walking, although, he can only run about 50 yards before getting very short of breath. He has no orthopnea or PND. He has no chest pain or use of sublingual nitro. 3. Health maintenance. We discussed screening colonoscopy versus flexible sigmoidoscopy and the relative benefit of each of those. He has agreed to proceed with colonoscopy, and I have instructed him stop his Coumadin and aspirin five days before the test and to have an INR checked on the day prior to the test. This will be scheduled by our secretary. He will restart the Coumadin after the colonoscopy at his standard dose and titrate up slowly.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Include aspirin, atenolol, insulin, Coumadin, and Lipitor.\n\n\n\nFoy, Keonte 73235790 06\/15\/70 Page 2\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His blood pressure is 148\/82. He is tachycardic at 98 beats per minute. Examination of his eyes shows persistent left- sided cataract. Examination of the heart and lungs was normal. The abdominal examination is also normal. His injection sites were clean and without erythema. There is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy and his feet appeared well.\nWe spent some time today talking about diabetes education again, including appropriate foods, drinks, and what items to avoid.\nPLAN: 1. Supplied educational materials regarding diabetes management, including calorie counting, weight loss, information about hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and diabetic eye care. 2. I have increased insulin in the mornings from 14 to 16 units and left the other doses as is. 3. I have increased the atenolol from 25 mg to 50 mg for hypertension and cardioprotection with the tachycardia. 4. We will check cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-7. 5. I have scheduled an elective outpatient colonoscopy as detailed above for colorectal cancer screening. 6. Return to see in a week's time, understands. He can discuss any management issues regarding his insulin doses or others anytime.\n\nYale Jordan, M.D.\nYJ:isenberg:74:585:40;00-10142.doc;DD:06\/15\/70;DT:06\/16\/70;DV:06\/15\/70\n\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\n\n62 year old man with dm and vascular disease.

She also has had a TAH and is on Premarin replacement. She has had only one prior visit in Internal Medicine one year ago with Dr. Eric Olds, and since then has been seen for med refills by nurse practitioners. She has had no specific complaints, has been relatively compliant with her medicines although her understanding of her disease process appears to be limited. She currently is taking Micronase 10 mg. a day, an aspirin a day, and Premarin .625 mg. a day. She describes intermittent symptoms of hyperglycemia, although she follows her blood sugars with urine dipsticks and says that they have been running in the non-detected range most often. She has not had any new visual blurring, excessive polydipsia or polyuria. She has not been taking her Synthroid medication for the past year since she last saw Dr. Olds, since she ran out of the medication. She has made no effort to get a refill on this, and has not noticed any significant difference. She denies excessive fatigue, palpitations, constipation, or lethargy, yet she inquires today about potentially restarting this medicine. She has no other specific complaints. She has a good energy level. Social History: She works at Nvidia and lives with her son. Allergies: None. Habits: She does not drink. She had quit smoking a year ago, but has been smoking this past week due to some stresses at home, and is planning on stopping this. Physical Exam: Blood pressure 148\/83. Pulse 70 and regular. HEENT exam reveals a palpable right thyroid lobe and an absent left thyroid lobe without specific nodularity or tenderness. She has no adenopathy. Her oropharynx is clear. Her chest is clear to auscultation. Cardiac exam: regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without murmurs or rubs. Her abdomen is obese, soft and non-tender. She has abnormal pigmentation across her skin, including her palms and her soles of her feet, and no peripheral edema. Assessment\/Plan: 1) Diabetes mellitus. Will continue on Micronase 10 mg. a day, check a hemoglobin A1C, and send her to the eye doctor. We have talked about good foot hygiene, and she will continue to check her urine dipsticks. 2) History of multinodular goiter. I will send a TSH today to assess her DLC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES Stephenson, Brenna Page 2 92819461 8-30-75 need for Synthroid replacement. 3) Routine health screening. She does not need a pap smear. She has had a TAH; however, I will perform a mammogram on her today. She will come back and see me in one month to get the results of these tests, and we will make treatment decisions at that time.

She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted. She had 1mm and 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary disease. She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising vigorously, which is rapidly walking. She vehemently denies that she has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion. We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not interested in intervention if we can manage her medically. PLAN: I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin. She refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need for taking it. She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is on atenolol. Today blood pressure was 164\/82 and her pulse was 80. We will increase the atenolol as tolerated. I will continue to work with her strenuously on risk factor modification. Her other risk factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95. Her diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this. She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the hospital.

I confirm\nthat I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the\nresident's documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed\nthe evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: A 57-year-old with back pain.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a young woman with a\ncomplicated past medical history, presents with a chronic history\nof low back pain, worse over the last week. She states that 3\nyears ago, she had a motor vehicle accident. Since that time,\nhas had chronic low back pain. She has been able to ambulate at\nhome. Denies any fevers, rashes, history of urinary\nincontinence, weakness, or numbness. She went to EDUCARE-FARGO earlier\nthis week and was prescribed Percocet, comes here now because the\npatient's family and the patient would like to change her care to\nLansing Dover Clinic. Denies any numbness or weakness.\nStates that she is no longer taking her pills at home. Denies\nany suicidal or homicidal ideation, has a flat affect. Denies\nany depression. Her son, however, with whom she lives disagrees\nand is very concerned that she may be depressed. He is also very\nconcerned that she is not taking her medicines and that she is\nnot caring for herself well at home.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for hypertension, diabetes, and\na prior stroke.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She has also had knee surgery.\nSOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per\nthe written note. The patient was counseled regarding smoking\ncessation.\nMEDICATIONS: Hydrochlorothiazide and Coumadin.\nALLERGIES: None.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is awake and alert in no acute\ndistress. Vital signs are within normal limits as documented.\nFor full physical exam findings, please see the resident's\nwritten note. Specifically, HEENT, neck, respiratory, cardiac,\nrectal, and abdominal exam are within normal limits as\ndocumented. Skin exam is remarkable for erythematous changes in\nthe groin where the patient has significant skin fold due to\nobesity. Musculoskeletal exam is otherwise unremarkable. Range\nof motion is full. Strength and tone is normal. The patient\ndoes have a positive straight leg raise on the left, reproducing\nher back pain. Neurologically, the patient has a flat affect but\nis oriented with intact cranial nerves and no focal neurologic\ndeficit in either motor or sensory distribution. She does,\nhowever, walk with a limp, which is chronic for her.\nLABORATORY DATA: White blood count is slightly elevated at 11.3.\nBUN and creatinine is also significantly elevated at 26 and 1.1,\nrespectively. Potassium is also quite low at 2.9. Urinalysis is\npositive with 35-40 white blood cells, 15-20 red blood cells, and\n2+ bacteria.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: My chief concern for this patient\nis her inability to care for self at home. It is apparent that\nher son is interested in helping her and do so, but the patient\non physical exam has some obvious lack of hygiene and I am\nconcerned that potentially the patient has either an underlying\nneurologic or psychiatric issue that is preventing her from\nthriving at home. Psychiatry initially was consulted. Their\nimpression was that the patient may have neuro behavior problem\nthat needs further outpatient workup, and she was referred to a\nspecific providers within the next 2 weeks. The patient was\ntreated with potassium chloride for her hypokalemia. Care\ncoordinator and social services were consulted. The patient will\nhave a home safety evaluation and will be referred for primary\ncare services, was discharged with a cane for ambulation, and\nwill likely also receive VNA Services to help her with medication\ncompliance and other ADLs.\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\nDIAGNOSES:\n1.

As you recall, he is a very pleasant 71-year-old gentleman with a history of right-sided trigeminal neuralgia. He has pain behind the right eye that has been present for 3 years. He describes it as a very sharp, severe, stabbing pain. He takes Tegretol, which helps but does not completely alleviate the pain. Over the past month the pain has become worse and increasingly intolerable. He has increased his Tegretol dose to 800 mg per day, which is about the limit of what he can tolerate.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, asthma.\nMEDICATIONS: Levothyroxine, Lyrica, Tegretol, glyburide and metformin.\nALLERGIES: None.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cholecystectomy.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired, a laboratory technician and lives in cincinnati.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Noncontributory.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant, older man in mild distress secondary to the pain. His mental status, cranial nerve examination, strength and sensation were normal.\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: In summary, this is a patient with what seems to be right V1 trigeminal neuralgia. The fact that he responded to the Tegretol is encouraging. I discussed the different options with him including no surgery, radiofrequency rhizotomy, and microvascular decompression. He elected to proceed with a microvascular decompression. I discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and all his questions were answered. A surgical consent was obtained. The plan is to perform the surgery on 08\/31\/2135. Prior to proceeding, I would like to obtain a dedicated brain MRI with fine cuts through the posterior fossa to better assess the neurovascular anatomy.\nI thank you very much and look forward to hearing from you in the future.\n\nJoshua U.

He ruled in for an myocardial infarction with a troponin on 2.0. He was found to be in congestive heart failure. He was given plavix, aspirin, lovenox and IV lasix with improvement in symptoms. On 08\/31\/2135, he was transferred to Gibson Community Hospital for cardiac catheterization. The results were significant for multivessel coronary artery disease and moderate mitral valve regurgitation with an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 to 30%. He was referred to Dr. Sebastian Dang for elective cardiac surgical revascularization and possible mitral valve repair. He was discharged to home on 09\/02\/2135. On 09\/03\/2135, he developed recurrent left sided chest pressure while at rest. He took 2 SL TNG with improvement in symptoms. He presented to Gibson Community Hospital ED. He was started on IV heparin. Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative. He was found to have an elevated BNP to 2817. A CXR showed congestive heart failure. He was admitted to CAU. He had an episode of chest pressure while at rest that resolved with 1 SL TNG. He is being referred for consideration of cardiac surgery.\nIndications Congestive Heart Failure Unstable Angina\nPre-operative risk factors Weight (lb): 150.5 Height (in): 70.5 Diabetes type: Diabetes Mellitus Type II Diabetes Control: Oral Dyslipidemia Preop Creatinine: 0.93 Hypertension\nPrior CV Interventions\nOther Past Medical\/Surgical History Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Diabetes Mellitus Type II Asthma Hypothyroidism Trigeminal Neuralgia-on lyrica and tegretol Cholecystectomy\nAllergies NKA: No Known Allergies\nAdmission medications Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) 325 mg PO DAILY Glucophage (metformin) 500 mg PO DAILY Lasix (furosemide) 40 mg PO Bid Lisinopril 5 mg PO DAILY Lopressor (metoprolol tartrate) 25 mg PO Bid Lyrica 75 mg PO Qam; 75 mg at 5pm, 150 mg at Qhs Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg (nitroglycerin 1\/200 (0.3 mg)) 1 tab SL prn Synthroid (levothyroxine sodium) 100 microgram PO DAILY Tegretol-xr (carbamazepine extended release) 500 mg PO Bid\nCurrent Medications Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) 325 MG PO QAM Atorvastatin (lipitor) 80 MG PO QPM Atropine sulfate 0.5-1 MG IV PUSH DAILY Carbamazepine (tegretol) 500 MG PO BID Docusate sodium (colace) 100 MG PO BID Furosemide (lasix) 20 MG PO DAILY Glyburide 5 MG PO QAM BEFORE BREAKFAST Heparin cardiac sliding scale iv 500-1500 Units\/Hr IV CONTINUOUS INFUSION Insulin regular inj Sliding Scale SC BID BEFORE BREAKFAST AND BEFORE SUPPER Isosorbide dinitrate 10 MG PO TID Kcl immediate release (potassium chloride immed. rel.) 20 MEQ PO Q4H Kcl immediate release (potassium chloride immed. rel.) 40 MEQ PO Q4H Levothyroxine sodium 100 MCG PO DAILY Metoprolol tartrate (lopressor) 12.5 MG PO TID Nitroglycerin 1\/200 (0.3 mg) 1 TAB SL Q 5 mins X 3 doses Potassium chloride sustained release tab 40 MEQ PO Q4H Potassium chloride sustained release tab 20 MEQ PO Q4H Pregabalin (lyrica) 75 MG PO at 5 PM Pregabalin (lyrica) 75 MG PO in am Pregabalin (lyrica) 150 MG PO bedtime Ranitidine hcl (zantac) 150 MG PO BID Sodium chloride 0.9% flush 3 ML IV Q2H Sodium chloride 0.9% flush 3 ML IV Q8H\nPreop Cardiac Status Myocardial Infarction: (08\/30\/2135, 09\/03\/2135) When: >6 Hours and < 24 Hours Heart Failure NYHA Classification: NYHA CLASS III Cardiac Presentation: NSTEMI, Unstable Angina\nPreoperative Hemodynamics and Diagnostic Testing\nEcho -surface echocardiogram ordered\nECG -SB, Q waves in V1-V4\nCarotid Non-Invasive Study -09\/01\/2135 CNIS's reveal normal (B) ICA's\nSocial History Occupation: retired technician Other Notes: -married; 2 adult children\nFamily History Diabetes CVA\/TIA Other notes: -Father died of an myocardial infarction at age 74-Mother with DM, died of cerebral vascular accident or myocardial infarction at age 84\nReview of Systems -as mentioned in HPI\nPhysical Exam BP (Right): 100\/50; BP (Left): 100\/50; Pulse: 54; Rhythm: SB GENERAL: Well appearing, thin gentleman lying in bed in no acute distress HEENT: Oropharynx benign, moist mucous membranes, anicteric TEETH: In good repair NECK: Supple, no JVD CV: RRR, S1S2, 2\/6 SM PULM: Clear bilaterally SKIN: No lesions or rashes EXTREMETIES: Warm, no edema ABD: Well healed RUQ incision, +BS, soft, non-tender, no organomegaly RECTAL: Normal tone, no masses, enlarged prostate, soft formed brown guaiac (-) stool NEURO: Alert and oriented x 3, non-focal Saphenous Vein: Bilateral GSV's appear suitable on standing Pulses: (B) Carotid: 2+; Brachial: 2+; Radial: 2+; Ulnar: 1+ Femoral: 2+; Popliteal: trace ; Post Tibial: trace ; Dorsalis Pedis: 1+ Bruits: (B) Femoral Bruit: none appreciated ; Carotid Bruit: (L) present\nChest X-ray -09\/01\/2135 Pa\/Lat CXR: edema, (B) effusions\nMost Recent Labs (since admission) -- -- 2135\/09\/04 09:13 - WBC. 5.3 th\/cmm 2135\/09\/04 09:13 - Hgb. 11.0 gm\/dl (L) 2135\/09\/04 09:13 - Hct. 31.3 % (L) 2135\/09\/04 09:13 - Plt. 211 th\/cumm -- -- 2135\/09\/03 15:06 - P Na. 127 mmol\/L (L) 2135\/09\/04 07:42 - P K. 4.3 mmol\/L 2135\/09\/03 15:06 - P Cl. 91 mmol\/L (L) 2135\/09\/03 15:06 - P TCO2. 28.1 mmol\/L 2135\/09\/03 15:06 - P BUN. 18 mg\/dl 2135\/09\/03 15:06 - P Cre. 0.93 mg\/dl 2135\/09\/04 07:42 - P Glu. 131 mg\/dl (H) 2135\/09\/03 15:06 - Phos. 3.5 mg\/dl 2135\/09\/03 15:06 - Mg. 1.7 meq\/L -- -- 2135\/09\/04 07:42 - CPK. 47 U\/L (L) 2135\/09\/03 15:09 - TROPON.

He sufferred a NSTEMI on 8\/30\/35. A cath at that time revealed an occluded mid LAD lesion, a 75% ostial OM2 stenosis, a 90% OM4 stenosis, and a non-dominant RCA with a 90% stenosis. His LVEF was estimated at 25-30% with moderate MR. He was discharged home on 9\/02\/35 to orbit for future CABG. 9\/03\/35 He was admitted to Natchaug Hospital secondary to recurrent rest pain. n 9\/04\/35 Echo revealing moderate MR with no other significant valvular abnormalities. There was segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving the septal, apical, inferior, and anterior territories. EF 55%. There was segmental right ventricular dysfunction involving the apex. The plan was for this patient to undergo CABG; however the patients wife was involved in a serious MVA, and with further discussion the decision was made to take him to the cath lab to attempt PCI so that the patient could be with his wife as soon as possible. 9\/05\/35 He was taken to the CCL. mid LAD had a 100% occlusion after the D1. The D1 was a small vessel with an ostial, eccentric, 90% lesion. The OM2 had a 60% eccentric lesion that did not appear flow limiting. The LPDA had a 95% complex lesion in the proximal third. He underwent stenting of the native mid LAD with a Xience OTW 2.5 X 23mm stent with an excellent result. This was followed by kissing-balloon angioplasty of the ostium of the 1st diagonal and the LAD. The pre-intervention stenosis was 90% with 0% residual stenosis. Finally, stenting of the proximal third of the left PDA was performed using a Xience V 2.5 x 15mm and a 2.5 x 12mm stent. The pre-intervention stenosis was 95% with 0% residual stenosis. At the end of the case, there was TIMI III flow throughout with no perforation or dissection. The patient remained stable throughout the rest of the admission with no further chest discomfort. He was discharged home on 9\/06\/35.\nSince his discharge he has noticed that he was dyspneic with lying flat. He has also noticed some exertional fatigue and dyspnea. He presented to Natchaug Hospital for further evaluation. His ECG showed no acute changes, CXR consistent with mild CHF. He has been aggressively diuresed with improvement in his level of dyspnea. He was transferred to GCH for a repeat cardiac catheterization. Cath today revealing: Widely patent LAD and LPDA stents. Balloon angioplasty site of proximal D1 patent.

The patient has been followed fairly frequently in the clinic recently for diabetic foot ulcers on his right foot, between his 4th and 5th toe. This evening, he presents with worsening ulcers in that area and also a new ulcer between his 3rd and 4th toes. It has not improved with good skin care and application of bacitracin; in fact, it has worsened.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies any bleeding with brushing of his teeth. He denies any palpitations or chest pain. He denies any shortness of breath or cough. He denies any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. He states that his bowel movements have become darkened secondary to his iron intake. He denies any symptoms of frequency or nocturia, no burning, itching, or pain with urination. He states that he has occasional elbow pain, which is relieved with Motrin.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature is 97.8 degrees, his pulse is 88, his blood pressure is 135\/65, weight is 141 pounds, and his random blood sugar is 159. He states that he did not take his medication today. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm at 88. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There are bruises noted on his right hand and left upper arm, but he states that both of these were related to trauma. Examination of his feet revealed his toes to be more reddened and somewhat shiny, shinier than previous visits. They were cool to touch. On his right foot, there was a new dime-sized blister on the 4th toe, and the toe that bordered his 3rd toe, and on the other side. There was an increase in the size on the toe ulcer and also on the ulcer on his 5th toe. Scant amount of drainage was noted from the toe areas.

I followed him in the hospital\nwhen he was admitted in Apr for a left foot ulcer. As you know, he is a 77\nyear-old man from Eritrea with a history of diabetes, hypertension and\nhyperlipidemia, as well as peripheral vascular disease who has had bilateral\nlower extremity bypasses in the past.\n\nHe was admitted in Apr of 2091 with a nonhealing left lower extremity ulcer\nfor lower extremity redo bypass surgery. His preoperative evaluation\nincluded\na Dobutamine echocardiogram, which revealed a small area of Dobutamine\ninduced\nhypokinesis in the inferior wall. Since this was a small area, it was felt\nhe\ncould proceed with surgery with moderate risk on a beta-blocker. He\nunderwent\nleft lower extremity peripheral bypass surgery and did well postoperative\nwith\nno symptoms of chest pain and no change in his EKG.\n\nHowever postoperative enzymes revealed peak CK of 455 with an MB fraction of\n35 and a troponin of 19.5. As a result of his large troponin leak, he\nunderwent cardiac catheterization on Apr 15, 2091 which revealed an 80% left\nmain stenosis, 100% totally occluded left anterior descending coronary\nartery,\n100% proximal first diagonal and a 60-70% lesion at the ostium of the\nposterior descending coronary artery with about a 50% lesion in the distal\nPDA.\n\nPostoperative echocardiogram on Apr 13, 2091 revealed an ejection fraction of\n45% with apical hypokinesis and mild mitral insufficiency. Due to\nhis severe left main stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting\non\nApr 20, 2091. He had LIMA to his left anterior descending artery and a vein\ngraft to his obtuse marginal artery. He did not have a graft to his\nposterior\ndescending artery since he had a limit to the number of conduits secondary\n\n\n\n\nNicholas-Xaviar, Fred\nMR #65856594\nMay 08, 2091\nPage Two\n\n\nto his multiple peripheral vascular surgeries.\n\nPostoperatively he did quite well and was discharged to rehabilitation on\nApril\n27, 2091. His medications on discharge were aspirin 325mg, Zocor 20mg,\nSubcutaneous Heparin 5000 units b.i.d, Metformin 500mg, Glipizide 10 in the\nmorning and 5 in the evening, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d. and Lopressor 25mg q.i.d.\n\nSince that time, he has done quite well. He has been progressing at\nrehabilitation to the point that he is now walking ten minutes three times\nper\nday and is working on walking up stairs since he lives on the second floor of\nhis house. He denies any chest pain with walking. He has no shortness of\nbreath or dyspnea on exertion. He has been sleeping on two pillows for a\nlong\ntime and this is unchanged. He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or\nclaudication symptoms with walking at this time. He does complain of some\npain in his left shin just below his knee, particularly with palpation. He\nhas\nplans to be discharged from rehabilitation in a few days.\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure is 135\/80 with a heart rate of\n60.\nHis jugular venous pressure is flat, and he has good carotid upstrokes\nwithout carotid bruits. His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion\nbilaterally. His heart has a slight laterally displaced PMI with a regular\nrate and rhythm, normal S1, and S2 and no audible murmur or gallop. His\nchest\nincision as well as his lower extremity and arm incisions is healing well. He\nhas a small scrape on the inner aspect of his left leg, which is also healing\nwell. There is some red discoloration below this lesion that is not warm and\ndoes not appear to be cellulitic. His feet are warm.\n\nHis EKG in my office reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 with T wave inversions\nin V1 through V5, 1 and L. They are particularly deep in V2 and V3 but are\nunchanged from his discharge EKG from the hospital.\n\nIn summary, Mr. Nicholas-Xaviar is a 77 year-old gentleman with diabetes,\nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular\ndisease who is two weeks status post coronary artery bypass grafting and\nthree\nweeks left lower extremity bypass who is doing quite well in his recovery.\nHe\nwill continue with rehabilitation and increase his exercise capacity over\ntime. I have reassured him and his granddaughter that he is doing very well\nand that it will take up to two months until he feels back to his baseline.\n\nI have recommended to him and to his rehabilitation facility that he increase\nhis Zocor from 20-40mg q.h.s.

He experienced mild central chest pain on the night prior to admission while working outdoors, pain resolved after about an hour and he attributed it to GERD. However, he awoke at 5:30 AM on the morning of presentation with recurrence of chest pain, 6\/10 severity, lasted for about 15-30 minutes and then resolved with Maalox. Pain recurred about 9:30, of similar severity, associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, non radiating, non-pleuritic. He again took zantac and Maalox without improvement. After 15 minutes he walked to the local hospital ER and during walk the pain increased in severity to 8\/10. He describes the pain as similar to his previous MI.\nUpon arrival to FHO found to have ST elevations antero-lateral. Given lopressor, heparin, integrillin, morphine, ASA, and medivac to WCH arranged for cath. He states that by the time he was in transit, his chest pain had resolved. He arrived at WCH, was taken directly to cath lab, found to have a proximal LAD lesion with cypher stent placed. He remained chest pain free following the procedure and was sent to the CCU in stable condition.\nAt baseline he states he can walk a couple of miles without rest, he rarely takes stairs on a daily basis. He smokes profusely and has little interest in quitting. He feels he has had no occurrence of chest pain since last one. However, he does report that his plavix was stopped recently, and he has difficulty affording all his medications.\nROS: Gen: denies f\/c\/ns HEENT: no dysphagia, throat pain Chest: no cough, dyspnea CV: denies orthopnea, pnd GI: no hematochezia, melena Skin: no rash\nPMHx: CAD: Cath 1\/73: 80% prox RCA stenosis w\/ thrombus, mod D1 stenosis, clear Lcx.

The LDL is now quite low at 93 but the HDL has declined to 34. All in all, the results are compatible with better glucose control and the action of Atorvastatin 10 mg is likely responsible for the very low LDL but on the other hand discontinuation of the gemfibrozil probably lowered the HDL. The effect on triglycerides of the low dose of the Atorvastatin is minimal and overall the triglyceride lowering effect is overrated except at the high dose of 80 mg. Even at 80 mg Atorvastatin could not compare to the fibrates in the triglyceride lowering action. Her current medications are Atorvastatin 10 mg, Lopressor 25 mg, Procardia 60 mg b.i.d, Capoten 50 mg t.i.d, and Insulin 22 units A.M. Labs: Cholesterol 220, TG. 460, HDL 34, LDL 93. Blood pressure is 120\/80. I restarted the Gemfibrozil, 600 mg b.i.d. and left her on the Atorvastatin 10 mg. Although I don't expect any side effects with this low dose of Atorvastatin and Gemfibrozil I warned Mrs. Werner and her husband that if she should have generalized muscle aches or weakness she should contact us and discontinue medication. I think that aggressive therapy is warranted in Mrs. Werner. page 2 Nancy Werner November 26, 2114 Please feel free to call or e-mail me if you have questions. Best Wishes. Sincerely, Isaac Q.

ZUBIA, M.D.\n\n\nOncology CONSULTATION NOTE:\n\nDATE OF CONSULTATION:\n\nDIAGNOSIS: T2b, NX, M0 Gleason 4+3=7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate.\n\nHISTORY: Mr. Meyar is a delightful patient referred to me by Dr. Osiel Mckee. His PSA in 2093 was 3.8, early this year 6.3, and on repeat 7.1. Abnormality was noted on digital rectal exam. He has very little in the way of voiding symptoms with a good stream, no dribbling, nor any frequency. He does still have his erections, though they are not as good as they used to be. The erections are still an important issue with him. Dr. Mckee performed a transrectal ultrasound that showed a 13 cc prostate. He took 12 biopsy cores and all 12 demonstrated prostate cancer. In 4 it was Gleason 6 and in the remainder Gleason 7. Many cores had a predominant Gleason 4 pattern. Many of the cores were heavily involved with 40% involvement or more. Mr. Mercado has a CT scan and a pelvic MRI scheduled for next week.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Diabetes.\n2. Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy.\n3. Tonsillectomy.\n4. Right inguinal hernia repair.\n5. Inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Glipizide, metformin, and Avandia.\n\nDRUG ALLERGIES: None known.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: His father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his late 70s, but he did not die from his disease.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He works as a Web Developer in Audiovox. He is married and came with his wife to the appointment today. He has no children. He is a former smoker and occasional drinker.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nNo anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing\nNo gynecomastia\nRespiration comfortable\nNo neurologic abnormalities in the arms or legs\nNo skeletal deformity or tenderness\nHead, eyes, ears, and nose normal\nAbdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.\nNo hernias.\nNormal penis, scrotum, and testes.\nRectum: no mural lesion. Stool guaiac negative\nProstate is small. The entire right side of his gland is taken up with tumor.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: Mr. Meyer is a young man with a significant and quite bulky prostate cancer. I certainly do not think active surveillance is an option for him, which is a shame, as that was his preference. Left untreated, I think he will be in deep trouble at some stage over the next few years. His second choice for treatment is prostate brachytherapy but again I believe his disease is too extensive for this and brachytherapy would represent significant under treatment.\n\nOn balance, my preference for him is either to have a radical prostatectomy, perhaps followed by postoperative radiation or alternatively, if he wishes to avoid surgery and he does, for him to have high-dose external radiation in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation. While I think he will recover good voiding function after either of these treatment combinations his sex life is under threat and he is aware of this. We will defer the final decision next week until he has had his scans. Obviously, should they show extensive extracapsular disease then surgery will be off the table, if they show nodal disease the same is true and we will be thinking in terms of long-term androgen deprivation. Hopefully neither of these scenarios will occur.\n\n\n\n\nVictor M. Zubia, M.D.\n\ncc:\nOsiel U.

ZUBIA, MD\nDATES OF RADIATION: 5\/27\/95 - 7\/24\/95 (58 elapsed days)\nDIAGNOSIS: Prostate adenocarcinoma T2B Nx, Gleason 4+3 = 7, PSA 7.1\nCONCISE HISTORY: Mr. Meyer is a 63 year old man who was found to have an elevated PSA of 7.1 on screening exam. An abnormality was also noted on DRE at that time. Prostate biopsy was performed, and all 12 cores were positive for disease, including 8 cores with Gleason 7 disease. Prostatic MRI showed no evidence of extracapsular extension. CT of the abdomen and bone scan revealed no evidence of metastatic disease. He was treated with definitive radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicles by IMRT, with concomitant Zoladex treatment.\nSPECIAL TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The patient underwent CT-based imaging to define the target volume and the normal tissue structures and 3D treatment planning was performed for treatment with IMRT. Daily localization of the prostate was done using the BAT ultrasound.\nSUMMARY OF RADIATION AND TREATMENT ADMINISTERED: The treatment site was the prostate gland plus the caudal seminal vesicles followed by a boost to the prostate alone.\nThe patient underwent external beam radiotherapy to the prostate and caudal seminal vesicles to a dose of 45 Gy given as 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy\/day. He then underwent a boost to the prostate only of 34. Gy given in 17 fractions of 2 Gy\/day for a total dose of 79 Gy.\nCLINICAL COURSE: The patient developed mild nocturia and more frequent bowel movements, for which he took Flomax and Metamucil. Mr. Meyer has tolerated his androgen deprivation therapy well.\nFOLLOW-UP: Mr. Meyer will follow up with us in 3 months with a PSA in advance.\nUlysses Imler, MD (Resident)\nVictor Zubia, MD (Attending)\ncc:\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2095-12-02\nSECTIONS OF THIS NOTE WERE CREATED WITH A 'COPY AND PASTE' ACTION.

Jordan Duran:\n64 y.o. male with known CAD. He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095. At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling. He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally. He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes.\nHe was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA. His ejection fraction at that time was 40%. He was referred for surgery. He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1.\nHe now presents with recurrent chest burning. He states that it is similar in nature to his symptoms prior to CABG. His chest burning is exertional and is relieved with rest. He denies dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and diaphoresis. During a follow up appointment at SCH, he was referred for a stress test. Per Bruce Protocol he exercised 6 minutes and 0 seconds. He states that his chest burning symptoms returned and were lessened with SL TNG, though not completely resolved. MIBI images reveal severe large perfusion defect extending from the septum to apex with reversibility. There is also a fixed basal infero-lateral territory consistent with infarct. His ejection fraction is 46%. He was admitted for cardiac catheterization done today with full report pending.

He was seen in the emergency room on 10\/21 with the\ncomplaint of urinary frequency, hesitancy, and generally not feeling well.\nPrior to that, he had been treated with antibiotics by his primary care\nphysician for a urinary tract infection with Bactrim and then ampicillin but\nhe did not get better. He went to the emergency room and was admitted to the\nhospital because his blood sugar was in the 400s and he was diagnosed with\ndiabetes at that time. He was discharged on 10\/22\/78 on insulin NPH 30 units\nin\nthe morning and 15 units in the PM and was advised to follow up in the\noutpatient clinic today. Since discharge, his blood sugars have been in the\n200s. This afternoon, it is 242 2 hours after his last meal.\n\nPast Medical History: He has a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy. He\nsees a urologist and they are discussing a new procedure for the same. He\ncannot have because of his morbid obesity, he cannot be positioned on\nthe table for the same. He also gives a history of sleep apnea. No\nhypertension. He does have a history of gastric reflux and obesity.\n\nPast Surgical History: He has had bilateral hip surgery for slipped as\nan adolescent.\n\nReview of Systems: No chest pain. Positive review of systems for UTI symptoms\nwith increased frequency and hesitancy. Other review of systems-he has\narthritis generalized with more pain in the hip. Also has acid reflux.\n\nFamily History: Family history of obesity and hypertension but no diabetes or\ncoronary artery disease.\n\nSocial History: He is a smoker but is trying to quit. He smokes less than one\npack a day. He is a manager and is on disability. He has 2 children and is\nseparated.\n\nPhysical Examination: He is morbidly obese and weighs about 405 pounds. Blood\npressure 110\/88. Pulse 84. Skin exam-there is evidence of acanthosis\nnigricans. He has gynecomastia. Head and neck exam-atraumatic, normocephalic.\nExtraocular movements are intact. Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.\nCardiovascular system exam-S1, S2 heard. No S3, S4. Respiratory system-clear\nto auscultation and percussion. No added sounds. Abdomen-obese, very\ndifficult\nto examine for masses or hepatosplenomegaly. On limited exam, there are no\nmasses palpable. CNS-cranial nerves II-XII intact. Examination of feet with\nmonofilament is negative as he is not able to feel the monofilament in both\nfeet. This impairment is greater on the right foot than left.\n\nLabs done so far: hemoglobin A1c of 14, glucose on 10\/21 422, creatinine 1.7,\nBUN 22, sodium 132, potassium 4.5, chloride 97, liver function tests with ALT\n10, AST 10, alkaline phosphatase 126, bilirubin 0.4, total protein 8.1,\nalbumin 3.6, globulin 4.5, calcium 9.5, hemoglobin 15.\n\nAssessment and Plan: 1. New onset diabetes mellitus. The patient is morbidly\nobese, has features of insulin resistance. His blood sugars today are better\nsince admission. He is on insulin twice a day. He checks his blood sugars 3\ntimes a day and since discharge, they have been around 240 to 300. The\npatient\nis not a good candidate for metformin with his last creatinine of 1.7. He may\nbe a candidate for Avandia. At the present time, his alkaline phosphatase is\nmildly elevated but his ALT and AST are normal. He has difficulty coming to\nthe clinic and would prefer to have his visiting nurse and nutritionist\ncommunicate with the clinic physicians to adjust the dose of his insulin and\nalso have his blood tests done locally rather than here in the clinic. We\nwill\nincrease his NPH to 40 units in the morning and 26 units in the PM. We will\nwork with the visiting nurse and nutritionist to adjust the insulin dose and\nalso order lab tests. We will repeat his hemoglobin A1c in a month and also\nrepeat his creatinine and liver function tests at that time to see if he may\nbe a candidate for Avandia. I advised the patient to return to the clinic in\n6\nmonths and also for him to send the blood sugar results every week until his\nblood sugars are under better control.\n\n\nDr. Xan Dunn\nXD:ullmann\n\nDD: 10.25.78\/Rec=d 11.04.78 DT: 12.03.78\nDV: 10.25.78\n\n\n\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2080-07-03\n\nHistory of Present Illness\nPOD # 3\nProcedure femoral-femoral bypass graft\nSurgeon U.

Mr. Lockwood has been generally feeling well and has no complaints except ongoing left lower extremity edema in the foot only, which is unchanged times many years. He has otherwise been feeling relatively well. He continues to be followed by Dr. Aguilera who prefers to take a conservative approach given the difficulty of performing a bone marrow biopsy and low levels of IgA paraprotein.\nReview of systems is negative except as above. Fingersticks remain well controlled in the range of 80-150s.\nInterval family, social, and medical history are unchanged.\nCurrent Medications: Include lisinopril 20 once a day, Proscar 5 once a day, Flomax, aspirin 325 once a day, atenolol 25 once a day, trazodone, folate, MVI, saw palmetto, glucosamine, selenium, vitamin C and vitamin D, Lipitor 20 mg once a day, and Plavix 75 once a day.\nPhysical Exam: Well-developed, obese in no apparent distress. BP 169\/83 and pulse 58. Neck: Supple without JVP or lymphadenopathy. Chest: Clear to auscultation and percussion. Cardiovascular exam: S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Extremities: No edema, warm.\nLaboratory Data: Recent BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.5. Repeat labs will be done when he comes in next week for his routine labs at the SCH. Skeletal films are pending.\nImpression: Mr. Lockwood chronic kidney disease appears to be stable, as I have mentioned before, he most likely has some underlying diabetic and\/or hypertensive nephropathy, but I continue to wonder whether the IgA paraprotein is playing a role in the increasing proteinuria and mild CKD. Chemotherapy would be indicated if that were the case. He is being followed conservatively by Dr. Aguilera thus far in the absence of defniitive data. I have ordered skull and hip films today to look for evidence of myeloma-related bone disease, which if present could distinguish more significant disease from MGUS. I agree with Dr. Altman that in the absence of definitive data,as long as creatinine is improving and urinary protein levels remain stable the current approach is reasonable. However, we should have a low threshold for pushing Mr. Lockwood to having either a renal or more preferably bone marrow biopsy.\nIn the meantime because he continues to have protein and albumin in his urine, I have initiated dual angiotensin blockade and have added Cozaar 25 mg a day to his regimen. He will follow up with me in four months and will have labs next week at the SCH. Thank you for referring this patient.\nSincerely,\nHerbert Nunez, M.D, M.Sc.\n\n\neScription document:8-3687892 CSSten Tel\nCC: David Aguilera Southside Community Hospital 8 Foster Court Fairview, VT 85147\nDD: 04\/13\/83 DT: 04\/14\/83 DV: 04\/13\/83\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2094-10-26\nSaint John Valley Health Center 157 Peterborough Place KIM JR, DOUGLAS Sulphur, AR 26822 20163512 (426) 819-5183 10\/26\/94\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Followup of atrial fibrillation and recent lab results.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 54 year old male with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, borderline diabetes, and borderline hypertension who presents back to clinic for followup.

At the time, he sustained an injury to his\nright knee which healed and then began to break down, and he\ndeveloped a large wound which began draining and had foul odor.\nThe patient had continued difficulty ambulating and presented to\nthe emergency department for evaluation. The patient denies having\nany hardware in his knee. No history of osteomyelitis. No\nhardware. No history of peripheral neuropathy.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Patient denies any fevers or chills. No nausea\nor vomiting. No abdominal pain. No chest pain or shortness of\nbreath. Patient is only complaining of difficulty ambulating\nsecondary to the pain.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Two patellar tendon repairs at EDUCARE-PULLMAN in 2083,\nrepair of a patellar fracture. Recent diagnosis of diabetes,\natrial fibrillation. Hypertension, high cholesterol, and positive\nPPD.\nMEDICATIONS: Please see nurses note for list of medications.\nALLERGIES: PENICILLIN (rash).\nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY: The patient is a smoker. He\ndoes not drink alcohol. He works in engineering, and lives alone.\nFamily history is noncontributory.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Patient is awake, alert, talking\nin full sentences, in mild distress secondary to pain. VITAL\nSIGNS: Afebrile, temperature 99.3, respiratory rate 20, blood\npressure 161\/96, pulse 95. HEAD: Atraumatic. NECK: Supple.\nLUNGS: Clear to auscultation. No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.\nHEART: Regular rate. No murmurs, gallops or rubs. ABDOMEN:\nSoft, nontender. SKIN: A large ulcer to the right knee, right\nover the patella, with significant amount of break-down necrotic\ntissue and purulent discharge with a foul odor. The depth of the\nwound is difficult to assess. Intact motor function and sensation.\nFull flexion and extension of the knee, and evidence of well-healed\nmidline scar above the ulcer. NEURO: Intact with good pulses\npalpable throughout.\nLABORATORY EVALUATION: Plain film of the right knee, CT of the\nright knee, and laboratory values done. Laboratory values\ndemonstrated a white count of 14, ESR of 13, ESRP of 2.1. Rest of\nthe labs were normal except for an elevated glucose to 226. Film\nof the knee shows patellofemoral arthritis with no evidence of\nosteomyelitis, no hardware seen. CT of the knee showed a\nsuperficial ulcer to the depth of the patellar tendon but the\npatellar tendon itself was intact.\nTHERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: The patient was initially seen by\northopedic who felt that the ulcer was over the patellar tendon, at\nthe site of prior surgeries, with no effusion or joint pain, and\nnormal range of motion with joint involvement unlikely. We are all\nvery hesitant to tap this knee and it will not be done at this time\nfor fear of introducing infection into the joint. The patient is\nawaiting consultation by general surgery for probable admission and\ndebridement in the operating room. The plan at this time was to\nhold off on antibiotics. Blood cultures were sent. The patient is\nreceiving IV fluids.\nCONSULTATIONS (including PCP): Orthopedics, general surgery.\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: Knee ulcer.\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): The patient was\nadmitted and transitioned to ED Obs, awaiting evaluation by the\nsurgical service for probable admission.

She has been having symptoms of ataxia which are difficult to understand in the sense that I cannot get a clear history of her symptoms. At times she reports that she feels dizzy as if she might fall over to her right side. There is no associated vertigo, dysarthria or other symptoms. She has not actually had syncope. There is no positional component to her symptoms. I had scheduled her for an MRA\/MRI to evaluate those symptoms. The MRI does show some small microvascular changes in the coronal radiata, centrum ovale and bilateral pontine region. She had small chronic lacunar infarcts. She reports that she falls to the right, but the stroke seemed to be more on the right brain which would not necessarily correlate with her symptoms. She had some left internal carotid mild 30% proximal stenosis. Her vertebral arteries were patent with anti-grade flow.\nPHYSICAL EXAM: Small lacunar infarcts. Most likely related to hypertension rather than embolic disease. Her blood pressure has been very well controlled. In fact, today on exam, her blood pressure was 100\/60. She brought her medications with her and has been taking atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d, Cozaar 50 mg 1 tab twice a day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. She had not taken her medications today and her blood pressure here when I repeated it was 110\/70 in the right arm and 120\/70 in the left. Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits. Her lungs are clear without wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: History of hypertension. Now with lower blood pressure and some lightheadedness. We will d\/c her atenolol. I would like her to get a repeat blood pressure in one week. I discussed her MRI\/MRA findings with her. Long term we will need to continue to try and optimize her cholesterol levels and her diabetes. She will follow up in one week for a repeat blood pressure.\nJulie Fraser, M.D.\nJF\/crane\/powell\n\n* Record date: 2093-10-18\nNAME: Wilson, Gabriel\nMRN: 8514931\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Gabriel Wilson is a 72-year-old Croatian\nfemale, referred by Dr. Fraser for evaluation of complaints of dizziness. Her daughter,\nwho is a Library Manager here, accompanies her mother today. Apparently, for\nmany years, perhaps as many as five, her mother has complained of feeling pulled\nwhen she walks. This never occurs when lying down or sitting. It is only when she is\nwalking that she feels she is being pulled, either to the right, left, forward or\nbackward. At times, she does visibly veer when she walks. She has had one fall a\nnumber of months ago when she broke her wrist. She has not had any subsequent\nfalls. There is no associated true spinning vertigo, no associated visual change,\nnumbness, weakness, change in gait, change in speech and no headache. She actually\nfeels that over the past few weeks, it has been a little better, though prior to that, it\nwas a little more severe. Unable to associate this with any clear intervention.\nUnaware of any precipitating or alleviating symptoms.\n\nReview of other systems notable for general fatigue. Otherwise unremarkable. No\nchest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis B, diabetes, hypertension, GE reflux,\nhyperlipidemia, depression, cataracts.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Colace, Cozaar, Flonase, Fosamax, hydrochlorothiazide,\nLopid, meclizine p.r.n, Protonix, Prozac, Vioxx.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Negative for neurologic disease.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and lives with her niece. She neither drinks nor\nsmokes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, she is a pleasant, quiet, soft-spoken,\n72-year-old female. BP 140\/84. Cranial nerves II through XII intact to detailed exam,\nexcept for decreased hearing on the left. On motor exam, no rigidity, no drift. Good\npower throughout upper and lower extremities. She does, however, seem mildly\nbradykinetic diffusely. Finger tapping was slow bilaterally and symmetric. Amplitude\nis normal for finger tapping. Power in the lower extremities 5\/5. Sensory exam with\nmild vibratory loss in the toes. Finger-to-nose testing intact. Foot-tapping decreased\nbilaterally. Romberg sway. Her gait is slightly wide-based, with occasional veering to\neither side. She is unable to perform tandem. DTR's 2+ throughout, except for 1+\nankle jerks. Babinski flexor bilaterally.\n\nDATA: MRI\/MRA of the brain 8\/30 shows mild to moderate white matter\nhyperintensity in the corona radiata, centrum semiovale and moderate bilateral\npontine involvement and multifocal lacunar infarcts of the lentiform nuclei, right\ninternal capsule and bilateral thalami. Intracranial atherosclerosis is seen involving the\nanterior middle cerebral arteries with a greater degree of involvement of the\nposterior cerebral arteries and intermittent development of moderate mid-segment\nstenosis of the basilar artery. Bloodwork 2\/27: SMA7 normal, except glucose 134. 8\/30\nbili, total protein, albumin, globulin within normal limits. LFT's normal except SGOT\nelevated at 46.\n\nIMPRESSION: 72-year-old female with diabetes, chronic hepatitis C and\nhypertension, complaining of basically veering of her gait and feeling unsteady. She is\nsymptomatic only when she walks. Her exam is notable for mild vibratory loss in the\ntoes, likely due to diabetic neuropathy, bilateral lower-extremity dysmetria and the\nwide-based, at times veering gait. It appears that her gait difficulties with veering are\nmultifactorial, due to history of multiple lacunar infarcts and peripheral neuropathy.\nIt does not appear that these episodes are due to transient ischemic attacks, given\nthat she veered in the office while walking and stated that this was the symptom she\nis concerned about. However, given her mid-segment basilar stenosis seen on MRI,\nshe certainly could become symptomatic from this down the road, particularly if she\nbecame hypotensive. As she was unable to tolerate Aggrenox, will try adding\nPersantine at a lower dose at 25 mg b.i.d, along with an aspirin per day, to see if she\ncan tolerate gradually increased doses of Persantine. I will see her in follow up in two\nmonths to see how she is doing. May also consider checking CBC, given her\nsymptoms of fatigue and other bloodwork should these symptoms persist.\n\nHope Kincaid, M.D.\n\nCC: Julie Fraser, M.D.\n\nHK\/crane\/kang\n\n* Record date: 2094-05-08\n\n\n\nNAME: Wilson, Gabriel\nMRN: 8514931\n\nThe patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension,\nhyperlipidemia and multiple other medical problems. She has a history of TIAs and\nwas seeing the neurologist today for follow up. She has not had recent TIA symptoms\nbut related a history of exertional chest pain and was sent up here for evaluation.\nGriggs was translating and the patient reports that over the past two months she\nhas been getting chest pain and pressure with some shortness of breath after she\nwalks about one block. The symptom is a pressure symptom which radiates to both\nsides of her chest. It is not severe, sharp chest pain. It does not radiate to her back.\nThere is no associated rest pain or nocturnal pain. No PND, orthopnea or edema.\nThe last time she had the pain was two weeks ago. She has a history of TIAs and our\ngoal was to keep her blood pressure in the 140-160 range since they may be due to a\nlow flow state due to her vertebrobasilar disease.\n\nShe is on aspirin and Plavix.\n\nShe had a negative sestamibi ETT in 2087 except she had a very low work capacity.\nShe has not had a recent stress test.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her blood\npressure is 160\/70. Neck supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs clear without wheezes,\nrales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2, no diastolic murmur\nor gallop. Abdomen soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly. No edema.\n\nHer EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Patient with multiple cardiac risk factors and a story\nwhich sounds convincing for exertional angina. She has not had any symptoms in over\ntwo weeks. Will add low-dose Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. She should stop it if she\nfeels lightheaded on the medication. She should increase the aspirin to 325 q.d. We\nwill schedule her for a sestamibi ETT. She will follow-up in one week.\n\n\nJulie Fraser, M.D.\n\nJF\/crane\/powell\n\n* Record date: 2097-06-28\n\nVisit Note\n\nPatient Name: WILSON, GABRIEL MRN: 8514931\nDictated Date: 06\/29\/2097 Dictated By: Julie Fraser, M.D.\n\nDate of Visit: 06\/28\/2097\n\n\nPatient is a 76-year-old Croatian woman who came in today. Her daughter Gibbs was translating. She is a very complicated 76-year-old Croatian woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, vertebral basilar insufficiency, chronic hepatitis B and other medical problems. She is status post a right Bell's palsy in the past.\n\nRecently she has been sometimes living at her daughter's house and other times at her niece's house. They are trying to provide more support in terms of regulating that she takes her medication. When she stays at her daughter's Gibbs's house her daughter does check her sugars though her niece does not. Her blood pressure has been very labile recently and we recently added hydrochlorothiazide and nifedipine extended release 30 mg every day to her regimen in addition to her regular Cozaar and Toprol. Her daughter also has increased her insulin\/70\/30 to 48 units in the morning. She thinks that sometimes in the afternoon or late afternoon she may have some low sugars. She reports that her mother feels dizzy and has difficulty moving her left leg if her sugar gets low. She feels better if she is given orange juice or something to eat. She has had similar symptoms to that with low sugars in the past however when the daughter checks her sugars they are all in the 174 to 225 range. She has occasional sugars before bedtime that are 337 and 249. The lowest sugar she had was 88 before dinner.\n\nThe patient reports that she feels dizzy at times. She is a very difficult historian even with her daughter translating or with the other interpreters translating. She has not been having any chest pain or palpitations. Her dizziness is not related to standing up or lying down. No syncope, slurred speech, spinning dizziness, diplopia, or focal arm or leg weakness or numbness.\n\nOf note the chest pain she had complained about on the last visit when her daughter had noted she was cleaning has resolved.\n\nHer cardiac stress test from June 2094 showed an exercise capacity of 4 METS, EKG nondiagnostic due to submaximal heart rate response. No evidence for ischemia on the perfusion images. From March 2095 her vascular lab studies showed normal distal vertebral arteries and basilar arteries throughout its length. She also had carotid studies March 2095 that showed minimal disease of the right and left carotid. Her prior MRI from 07\/95 showed chronic lacunar infarcts but no acute hemorrhage or infarct.\n\nThe patient has had chronic slow speech and there is question about whether or not she has dementia. Her daughter is giving her the Aricept though it is not clear if this is benefiting her or not.

GOMES, M.D.\n\nMr. Curtis returns with a history of ureteral stones, BPH, and dysuria. He has not had any stone passage in the last six months. He has passed some tissue, and had some gross hematuria with his last visit, but has not had any symptoms since then.\n\nWith his BPH, he has not had any significant worsening of his nocturia or daytime frequency. He feels as if he is emptying his bladder well now on the Cardura. He did have some dysuria, and Dr. Geiger gave him a pill which seems to have helped him.\n\nHis review of systems today is negative. His past medical history is unchanged, and he is continuing with a cholesterol medication, a pill for burning, Cardura, and Atenolol.\n\nOn physical examination, his vital signs show him to be well-nourished and well-developed. His respirations are 14. His pulse is regular. A general examination shows his neck to be supple. He is alert and oriented x 3. He has no labored breathing. He has no palpable groin adenopathy. His skin has normal turgor, and his cardiovascular exam shows no JVD.\n\nA complete GU examination shows his epididymis to be without masses. A rectal exam shows his anus to be without masses. His scrotum is without lesions. His urethral meatus has no discharge. His prostate has some BPH, but no nodularity. His penis has no foreskin lesions. His testes have no masses. His seminal vesicles have no masses. His sphincter tone is normal.\n\nAn independent review of a urinalysis today is negative. A review of clinical lab testes shows a nuclear matrix protein less than 10 on 11\/14\/87. This was done via PCIS. A post-void residual today is 14 cc.\n\nFor his BPH, I believe he should continue with Cardura 2 mg p.o. q.d. His stone disease is quiescent, and he will let me know if there are any recurrences with symptoms of these. We will consider checking a KUB in one year's time. He will let me know if there are any difficulties in the interim.\n\n\nVictor R.

Mrs. Foust is a 65-year-old woman who is feeling significantly improved, but who complains of dizziness after she takes her medications. Her history of severe hypertension, without definite secondary causes, only a mild left renal artery stenosis, a recent admission for chest discomfort and hypertension, with a CTA that disclosed only modest plaques in her 3 major coronary arteries, treated dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, and vigorous left ventricular systolic function and significant left ventricular hypertrophy, is detailed above.\nMs. Foust feels that her life has been brought back to her. She takes her amlodipine, lisinopril, and carvedilol at 8:30 a.m. Thirty minutes later, she states that she feels lightheaded and her blood pressure can be in the 100\/70 mmHg range to 120\/80 mmHg range. She believes that her heart rate is approximately 60 beats per minute at those times. After 1-2 hours, she starts to feel improved. At 8:30 p.m, when she takes only her carvedilol and amlodipine, again, she has similar symptoms. When she has the symptoms, she sometimes also notices a discomfort in her low back. She has not had dyspnea and she has only rare episodes of mild chest heaviness. She has not had palpitations. She has not had actual lower extremity swelling, though she feels that after her metformin, her legs can feel heavy. She is not having an alteration in gastrointestinal or genitourinary habits. She has not had musculoskeletal achiness, aside from the low back discomfort described. She has not had any peripheral numbness. The rest of the review of systems is unremarkable.\nThe present medications are ASA 81 mg a.m, lisinopril 40 mg a.m, amlodipine one-half of a 10 mg tablet a.m, carvedilol 25 mg a.m. and 25 mg evening, simvastatin 40 mg before bedtime, and metformin 500 mg before dinner.\nOn examination, the weight is 110 pounds, decreased 3 pounds compared to 01\/96. The blood pressure was initially 136\/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12, and she was complaining of low back discomfort, and she was very slightly lightheaded. Later, the blood pressure was 160\/70 mmHg and she stated that her blood pressure has not been so high for the last several weeks. She was still complaining of slightly dizziness and low back discomfort. The skin is warm and dry and she looks quite calm. She is fully alert. The neck veins are not elevated. The carotid upstrokes are brisk and the volumes are normal. There are no carotid bruits though there was a transmitted murmur. The lungs are clear. The PMI is not displaced. There is a normal-sounding S1 and a physiologically split S2, with a soft, 2\/6 early-peaking systolic murmur across the aortic valve that decreases with Valsalva. The abdomen is benign. There is no renal artery bruit. The distal pulses remain excellent and there is no pedal edema. There is no tenderness of her skin. The resting electrocardiogram shows a sinus bradycardia at a rate of 56 beats per minute, intervals of 0.20\/0.08\/0.40, 45-degree axis, very slight inferolateral ST segment flattening.\nImpression: Mrs. Foust is feeling much-improved. The dizziness and low back discomfort that she describes could possibly be associated with a drop in blood pressure to 170 mmHg, with mild hypoperfusion of her spinal arteries, as well as her head. However, today she had dizziness even with a blood pressure of 160 mmHg. Though we could be tempted to juggle with her regimen and reduce her amlodipine slightly, or change the times when she takes the medications, I think that we are facing some difficulties only related to the poor autoregulation of her cerebral and peripheral vessels. I think that we should continue her on her present regimen. Gradually, we would expect her symptoms, related to changes in blood pressure, to improve as her vessel elasticity improves. I think that we can be satisfied that she is not becoming too bradycardic. We are pleased with the present regimen. We have never been absolutely certain that there has been no tiny penetrating aortic ulcer for her discomforts or so dramatic, but the treatment would be precisely as it is now. We were not surprised by her CTA and her treatment, naturally, remains unchanged. I think that we want her to continue her metformin, and we may have to consider increasing it to at least twice daily, depending on followup A1c values.\nThank you for allowing me to assist in Mrs. Foust's care. I know that you will continue to follow her closely. I told her that I would see her again in nine months.\nSincerely,\n\nStephen C Rice, M.D.\n\n\n\n\neScription document:8-1475473\n\n\nDD: 03\/18\/96 DT: 03\/19\/96 DV: 03\/18\/96\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2081-01-05\nReason for Visit: 72 yo M with Stage 3B lymphocyte depleted Hodgkin's who presents for cycle 3B of ABVD chemotherapy.\n\nOncology History:\n\nMr. Jimenez developed fevers, drenching night sweats, and a 15 pound weight loss in September of 2080. He was admitted to LCH on 10\/11\/80 at which point a fever workup was negative but CT scans revealed bulky lymphadenopaty in his neck and abdomen as well as splenomegaly. He underwent an excitional biopsy of a R supraclav node which was positive for lymphocyte depleted HD. A gallium scan and a PET scan were negative except for the biopsy site.

This appearance of fluid has decreased slightly since the previous study. There is no pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is demonstrated in the left hemithorax. There may be a small posterior left pleural effusion as well. There is subtle suggestion of Kerley B lines at the lung bases consistent with mild CHF. Heart and mediastinum: The heart and the mediastinum are unchanged from the prior study. The aortic arch is calcified and tortuous. Bones: The thoracic skeleton is unchanged from the prior study. IMPRESSION: Continued signs of atelectasis and pleural fluid involving predominantly the right mid and lower hemithorax. The appearance of this has improved slightly since the prior exam. No new focal consolidation is demonstrated compared to the prior study. There is subtle suggestion of Kerley B lines consistent with mild CHF. Plan: 1. Recurrent pleural effusion: for repeat CT chest. Continue treatment for CAP. 2. Hematuria: hold off Coumadin at present. Monitor Foley drainage. Consult Urology if no resolution. Otherwise for outpatient follow-up. 3. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Alert Dr Joyce of admission as courtesy. 4. A Fib: rate controlled at present. Hold off Coumadin. 5. HTN: BP poorly controlled.

As you recall, he is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, who initially presented with chest discomfort on 12\/09\/2092. Mr. Tanner ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time and underwent stress testing, which was positive. He returns today for diagnostic catheterization. Cardiac catheterization revealed noncritical coronary artery disease with an approximately 50% ostial right coronary artery lesion in a left dominant system. The right femoral arteriotomy site was manually compressed without complication. Mr. Tanner was admitted to the Cardiovascular Unit overnight for observation. Overnight he did well, specifically, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin, or flank pain. He remained hemodynamically stable, and was ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.\n\nOn examination, his cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout all lung fields. His groin was soft and mildly tender with no hematoma and no bruit noted. His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses.\n\nHis morning labs were significant for sodium of 142, potassium of 4.1, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1. A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 4.74, hematocrit of 31.6, and platelets of 304,000. A fasting lipid panel revealed total cholesterol of 107, triglycerides of 130, HDL of 30, and LDL of 51.\n\nWe are planning on discharging Mr. Tanner on the following medications, aspirin 81 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, diltiazem extended release 360 mg daily, Levoxyl 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, NPH insulin 80 units subcutaneous daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, and metformin 850 mg twice daily to start on 12\/21\/2092. We have asked that he follow up with you in the next one to two weeks, and to call with any questions or concerns before then.\n\nThank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us regarding his ongoing management.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nRebecca Eason, MD\n\n\n\n\nDictated by: Regan Montgomery, PA-C\n\n\n\neScription document:3-2644464 IFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 12\/20\/92\nDT: 12\/20\/92 DV: 12\/20\/92\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2098-04-01\n\nMr. Fredrick is a 48-year-old man status post right middle lobectomy on September 24, 2096, for T1N0 carcinoid.

His symptoms started on Tuesday afternoon, three days ago, while working in the yard. He describes substernal chest pressure that waxes and wanes in intensity, but has been constant since its onset. It does not radiate. It was associated with &#8220;gurgling&#8221; like &#8220;loose phlegm&#8221; in his chest at its onset, but this has since resolved. It was worse while sitting in the car or leaning forward or backward, but not with twisting. He has not had any recent URI symptoms. Tylenol helps take the edge off of his discomfort. He has been measuring his BP at home, and over the past few days it has ranged to 190\/102 averaging 170\/80. He reports compliance with his medications without recent changes. He has had worsened dyspnea on exertion, stating that he could walk 1+ miles one week ago, but could only manage 1\/4 mile today. He sleeps on two pillows with no changes, and he denies LE edema. His anginal equivalent includes jaw and neck pain and mild substernal chest pressure without radiation to his arms; he states his current symptoms are not consistent with his angina.\n\nHe called Dr. Upham, his cardiologist, and was told to increase his Lasix frequence to 20 mg BID. He was encouraged to come to the SSH ED for his symptoms given his history of CAD (below). On arrival, the vital signs were T 96.7, P 71, BP 166\/81, RR 18, Sat 97% RA. He had negative kiosk biomarkers and no EKG changes. He received NTG x3 without much relief and ASA at home.\n\nPAST CARDIOLOGICAL HISTORY\n- 1\/07\/05: SSCP (heaviness\/squeezing) radiating to left arm\/jaw with throat constriction (MSH); EKG: STD V3-V6, palpitations; CK peak 340, Troponin 7.8 (SSH)\n- 1\/18\/05: LHC (SSH): LAD mild, mLCX after OM1 severe, prox OM1 severe, mRCA severe, mild inferior hypokinesis, LVEF 50%, mLCX 2x12 mm Minivision, OM1 2x12 mm Minivision, mRCA 2.75x12 mm Minivision\n- 1\/20\/05: Echo (SSH): LA 44 LVIDd 47 PWT 11 IVS 11 LVEF 56%, ascending aorta 33\n- 5\/24\/05: ETT (MSH): HR 75-142 (86% MPHR - on Toprol), BP 150\/84-154\/100, EKG: NSR, 8 minutes, no CP, no ischemia on stress\n- 9\/07: ETT (Gordon Hospital): negative\n- 09\/26\/07: POD #2 s\/p radical prostatectomy 8\/10 CP at rest (mid sternal to neck\/left shoulder with diaphoresis); called 911 to SSH ER: EKG TWI inferiorly\n- 09\/26\/07: Echo (SSH): LA 39, LVIDd 52, PWT 10, IVS 10, LVEF 40%, mild MR, AV leaflets thickened with thin mobile echo densities c\/w Lamble&#8217;s excrescence, ascending aorta 34, WMA inferior\/septal\/anterior\/apical territories, LVEF 40%, new WMA compared to 2\/05\n- 09\/29\/07: Angio (SSH\/Dr Ochoa): LM patent, LAD 40% prox at D1, D1 50%, mLAD 85%, pOM2 30%, pOM3 30%, RCA (dominant) mRCA 70% at stent inlet, 95% mPDA, BMS PDA 2.25x12 mm, mLAD BMS 2.75x15 mm and 2.5x12 mm\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\nCAD (as above)\ns\/p radical prostatectomy (10\/07)\ns\/p RML resection for carcinoid tumor (2096)\ns\/p bleomycin rx (2085) and xrt (2084) for Hodgkins' disease\nDM2\nHTN\nGERD\ns\/p appendectomy (2061)\ns\/p knee surgery (2069)\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION\nAcetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin) 325 MG PO QD\nAtorvastatin (Lipitor) 80 MG PO QD\nGlyburide 5 MG PO BID BEFORE BREAKFAST AND BEFORE SUPPER\nLisinopril 20 MG PO BID\nMetformin 1000 MG PO BID BEFORE BREAKFAST AND BEFORE SUPPER\nNadolol 40 MG PO QD\nOmeprazole 20 MG PO QD\nZolpidem Tartrate (Ambien) 5 MG PO QHS\n\nALLERGIES\/ADVERSE REACTIONS\nPCN &#8211; rash; Shellfish\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\nF &#8211; d, 87, MI (47), CABG x2\nM- d, 84 Parkinson&#8217;s disease, DM\nB &#8211; CABG x2, CHF (50s)\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nLives in Kemmerer.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT: The patient is a 58-year-old non-English-speaking Hispanic woman who presents for evaluation of waxing and waning epigastric\/right upper quadrant abdominal pain for the past five days. The patient was in her usual state of health until one week ago, when she developed an upper respiratory tract infection. She was seen by her primary care physician, who treated her with Biaxin. The patient took the Biaxin; however, she developed some epigastric abdominal pain on Tuesday. She called her primary care physician, who attributed her abdominal pain to a Biaxin reaction. She was told to discontinue the Biaxin on Thursday. The patient denies any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. She denies any dysuria, polyuria, or hematuria. She denies any vaginal discharge. She denies any shortness of breath or chest pain. She denies any arm, jaw, or back pain. She denies any diaphoresis or dizziness. She does admit to some burping and indigestion. She describes the pain as cramping in nature. It waxes and wanes. It does not radiate anywhere. Nothing seems to improve or worsen the pain. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI, and otherwise negative. In particular, on cardiovascular review, she denies chest pain, arm pain, jaw pain, or back pain; she denies any diaphoresis, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea on exertion, or palpitations. On pulmonary, she admits to cough, but denies hemoptysis. The abdominal review is as per the HPI; she denies melena. The GU review is as per HPI. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: (1) Type I diabetes mellitus; (2) Hypertension; (3) Hypothyroidism; (4) Asthma; (5) Current upper respiratory tract infection. MEDICATIONS: Albuterol inhaler; glucophage; insulin; codeine. SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY: Negative tobacco. The family history is negative for diabetes mellitus. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, the vital signs reveal a temperature of 98.6 degrees F, a blood pressure of 146\/74, a pulse of 88, and a respiratory rate of 20. The O2 saturation is 96% on room air. In general, the patient is in no acute distress. The HEENT examination reveals the head to be normocephalic; the examination is atraumatic. EOMI. PERLA. The throat is clear. The neck is supple, with no JVD or bruits. The chest shows no crepitus or retractions. The lungs have coarse breath sounds. The heart has a regular rhythm and rate without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft, with some very mild epigastric tenderness, but no guarding, rebound, referred pain, flank tenderness, palpable masses, or pulsatile masses. The extremities are warm and well-perfused without cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. On neurologic, there are no focal findings. LABORATORY EVALUATION: The chest x-ray shows no acute pathology. The EKG shows a normal sinus rhythm at 90. THERAPY RENDERED\/COURSE IN ED: The working diagnosis was peptic ulcer disease exacerbation versus gastritis versus non-specific abdominal pain. The patient was status post cholecystectomy five years ago. She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She did not exhibit any stigmata of an acute coronary syndrome; however, given her history of diabetes mellitus and her age, an EKG was obtained and revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 90, without any ischemic or infarctive changes. She was medicated with 30 cc of Maalox and 150 mg of Axid, which seemed to improve her pain considerably. Serial abdominal examinations did not reveal any peritoneal signs or worsening abdominal pain. The patient did not have any medical records on the computer at this time. Nursing and Triage notes were reviewed and I concur in those findings. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal pain, suspect gastritis versus peptic ulcer disease. DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): The patient was given abdominal pain instructions in Spanish. She was given a prescription for Axid and for Maalox. She was to follow up with her primary care physician the next day and return if symptoms were to recur or worsen. She was discharged in improved and stable condition.

Her\ncomplaint is that for the last 5 days, she has had this bilateral\nneck pain with shortness of breath. She had no significant chest\npain, but complaining of dull achy pain and dull achy sensation\nthroughout her throat. She felt some sensation of her heart\nracing with her neck pain. Mild headache. No fevers however.\nShe has had no diaphoresis or nausea and vomiting. Blood\npressure initially was 212\/76.

She had an extensive cardiovascular work-up that showed no signs of cardiac ischemia. Her MIBI showed no evidence of scar or ischemia and an ejection fraction of 57%. On the other hand, her blood sugars were found to be in the 300-400s. Since then, she has been followed by the IM dept. She comes in today complaining of 2 main symptoms that have been occuring for several months now, and which in large part led to her recent hospitalization: 1) dyspnea that occurs on average twice a week, allevaited after 30 min of SL NTG, no precipitating factors identified. SOB not significantly imporved by albuterol. 2) neck pain, localized to the lateral aspects of her neck. She feels her veins exploding. Of note, she suffered left ankle pain, for which she self-medicated cephalexin (without knowing its an Abx), which she had at home. She says most of her symptoms resolved. Per her husband, she has always been a fairly anxious person.\n\nROS: No DOE, no PND, no fever. Good apetite, polydypsia. Blurry vision.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: A total thyroidectomy, on levothyroxine 200 mcg daily, COPD, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, sleep apnea, cholecystectomy and a meniscal tear.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS (updated)\n1) Albuterol inhaler\n2) Atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily\n3) Clonidine HCL 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n4) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily\n5) Flovent 220 mcg b.i.d.\n6) Levothyroxine 200 mcg p.o. daily\n7) Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. daily\n8) Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily,\n9) Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.\n10) Humulin 70\/30 90 U sc qAM, 70 U sc QPM\n11) Metformin 1000 mg PO BID\n12) SL NTG 0.3\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Ms. Riley is from Mexico. She has lived here for the last 15 years. Lives with her husband. Denies any tobacco or alcohol.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nWeight: 215 lbs. P 73, BP 122\/74, SO2 97% RA\nGen: Well nourished.

Obese.\nExtrem: Warm. 1+ non-pitting edema.\n\n\nIMPRESSION: Ms. Riley is a 66-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus, evidence of insulin resistance, most recent hemoglobin A1c was 9.4. Her symptoms are quite vague and difficult to put together. Importantly, myocardial ischemia has been ruled out by cardiac nucelar imaging. My two main differentials are 1) general anxiety, 2) GERD. Even though she does have a h\/o COPD, but based on her history, physical exam and lack of efficacy of bronchodilators in releiveing her symptoms, I don't believe major underlying lung disease explans her symtoms. We'll start her on klonopin 0.5 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg po qd. Follow-up with LIMA psychiatry clinic for management of anxiety.\n\nIn terms of her glucose, she is improving, but still not adequately controlled. She occasionally has blurry vision and is constantly thirsty. Her next appointment is in January. HBA1c yesterday=9.2, fasting glucose in the 200s. Last increase in her insluin was in 11\/30\/69, from 80 U QAM to 90 U QPM. For now, we'll increase her PM dose of insulin from 70 to 75 U SC QAM, and follow-up with her.\n\n\n\n\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\nDiscussed with Dr. Freddie Eric. 66 yo woman with poorly controlled DM. Recent admission for R\/O MI. A1C was in the 9s. Being followed by Internal Medicine. Has odd sensation of numbness climbing from her toes to her chest associated with SOB and a sense that her neck is exploding. It would appear that she is having anxiety. We will treat with fluoxetine and Klonopin and refer to Psych. We will also adjust her insulin further.\n\n\n\n\nKimball Lukas Abraham, M.D.\n\n* Record date: 2070-11-29\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Riley is a 67-year-old woman who presents to Internal Medicine for followup. Since her last visit, she has continued on her regimen of 70\/30, 90 units in the morning and up to 90 units at dinnertime (sometimes 1\/2 after dinner). She also uses Lispro 25 units at lunch. On this regimen, her morning blood sugars have ranged Pre-breakfast: 96-214, mostly 100-130. Pre (sometimes post) Dinner: 128-307, mostly 140-160\nThe good news is her last A1c dropped to 7.2% from 8.3% (1 year ago was 10.4%)\nShe has known retinopathy and has had multiple laser treatments. She goes routinely to the ophthalmologist, at least twice a year and several times a year to the podiatrist as well. She is otherwise in good health, though today she complains of depressed mood, for which she is in therapy.\nOn ROS she denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, polyuria, polydipsia, fevers, chills, diarrhea, vaginal or urinary symptoms, numbness or tingling of her lower extremities. She has not had any hypoglycemia. She does not exercise.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Status post total thyroidectomy (because of large goiter) on levothyroxine 200 mcg daily. COPD, obesity, CHF (EF 40%), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, sleep apnea, status post cholecystectomy.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Albuterol inhaler, Ambien, atenolol 50 mg daily, clonidine 0.2 mg b.i.d, aspirin 81 mg daily, Flovent b.i.d, levothyroxine 200 mcg p.o. daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, Nexium 40 mg daily, Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily and Lipitor 20 mg p.o. nightly, Metormin 1000 mg BID, Lasix 20 mg daily.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Ms. Riley is from Mexico. She has lived here for the last 15 years and denies tobacco or alcohol.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a well-appearing overweight woman.

No ulcerations or skin breakdown. Microfilament and vibratory sensation intact.\nPREVIOUS DATA: Labs from 11\/22\/70: TSH 0.137. Microalbumin was negative. Cholesterol was 109, LDL 40, HDL 36, TG 163 A1c 7.2%, down from 8.3% on 7\/31\/2070\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: In summary, Ms. Riley is a 67-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes for the last 20 years with poor glycemic control, but significant improvement recently, with latest hemoglobin A1c of 7.2%.\n1. Diabetes. Her sugars are much improved, as is her A1c. We will switch her 70\/30 regular to 70\/30 Novolog, given that she gives herself the insulin just after the meals and that she is using Novolog for lunch as well. We emphasized again the pm dose should NOT be pre-bed but pre-dinner. She will continue dose of 90 units QAM and Qdinner of 70\/30 and Lispro 25U for lunch. She will continue on metformin 1000 mg twice daily. She will continue to follow up with Opthalmology and Podiatry. Her blood pressure is in target range on clonidine and lisinopril. Her LDL is also in target range on Lipitor. She will continue on a baby aspirin. Her microalbumin is negative.\n2. Hypothyroidism. TSH somewhat suppressed, 0.137, will therefore reduce levothyroxine to 175 mcg QD\nShe will follow up in 3-4 month's time.\n\nWinnie Palacios, M.D.\n\n\n* Record date: 2072-05-24\nCC: routine f\/u\nHPI: 69 F with DM, CHF with preserved EF, GIB from a small bowel source, and diffuse body aches.\nShe has been feeling quite well recently, and states her shortness of breath seems better during the spring\/summer. Her mood is good, although she has persistent neck and shoulder pain for which she was seen in the pain clinic.\nRegarding her DM, her usual pre-and post-prandial FS are in the 160-220 range, on lantus 90 U BID and Novolog 60 U qAC for each meal.

He has been followed by his cardiologist, Yehuda\nLanders, for the last nine\nyears. Essentially he has every cardiac risk factor and known coronary\nartery disease which is\ndocumented on cardiac catheterization performed on 1\/20\/93. The\ncatheterization demonstrated\nright dominant system with 100% RCA lesion, a complex 30% diagonal 1 lesion\nand a 30%\nmarginal 1 lesion. There was collateral flow noted from the LAD to the right\nPDA and from the\nseptal 2 branch to the RCA, and from the circumflex artery to the RCA. The\nprocedure was\nperformed through the right radial artery without complications. Patient\nalso has peripheral\nvascular disease and is status post a left femoral posterior tibial saphenous\nvein bypass graft in\n2088. He is also status post atherectomy and dilatation of stenosis in the\nfemoral to posterior\ntibial graft. He also had a left leg DVT in 2090. His activity level is\nlimited by his claudication.\nHe has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and diabetes on\ntreatment.\n\nAt baseline he has dyspnea on exertion after walking half a mile. He gets\nchest pressure one to\ntwo times a month. However, his activity is extremely limited. He reports\nthat he has had a\npositive stress test. Further information is not available. Patient\nunderstands he has coronary\ndisease, however does not have amenable disease for angioplasty. On\ncatheterization he had\npreserved ejection fraction of 62%.\n\nHe is to undergo esophageal cancer surgery in the next one to two months\nafter receiving\nchemotherapy and radiation therapy preop. Patient states he will be\nreceiving a Hickman\nMichael Ogrady\nPage 2\nMarch 3, 2093\n\ncatheter and a jejunostomy tube placement before his chemo and radiation\ntherapy.\n\nOn physical exam, the patient is obese, weighing 288 pounds. His blood\npressure is 100\/72,\nheart rate is 57 bpm. HEENT: oropharynx benign. Neck: carotids intact\nbilaterally without\naudible bruits. Lungs: distant breath sounds. Cor: without obvious jugular\nvenous distention.\nHeart sounds distant. Normal S1 and S2. No appreciable murmurs. Abdomen:\nunable to palpate\nfirm masses or aortic aneurysm. Bowel sounds present. Extremities: status\npost surgery to the\nleft flank with 1 to 2+ edema to the knee. Distal pulses are absent. Neuro:\nintact.\n\nEKG: Sinus brady with first degree AV block. IMI with age undetermined.\nNonspecific STT\nwave abnormalities present. No previous EKG for comparison.\n\nImpression: 63-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male with known coronary\nartery disease and\nperipheral vascular disease who has preserved left ventricular function. He\nclearly has ischemia\non a positive stress test. I would recommend dobutamine echocardiogram to\ncheck ischemic\nthreshold. He is clearly at intermediate risk for a perioperative cardiac\nevent. However, given\nhis life-threatening esophageal carcinoma, patient wants to proceed with\nsurgery even\nunderstanding possible complications.\n\nPlan:\n1. Dobutamine echocardiogram to check ischemic threshold.\n2. Recommend intravenous beta-blockers during the surgery with fairly tight\ncontrol of\nblood pressure and heart rate, utilizing the information determined on\ndobutamine\nechocardiography.\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient, Michael\nOgrady. Please do\nnot hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\nSusan Ximena Elias, M.D, M.M.S.C.\n\n\/alvarado\n\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n* Record date: 2095-12-24\n\nGrafton State Physician Group\n567 Derby Circle OGRADY, MICHAEL\nTbilisi, OR 91623 28297534\n575-433-3737, 128-526-1384 12\/24\/95\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Ogrady is a 66-year-old gentleman who is coming in to Grafton Clinic to establish care and to discuss several medical issues.\n1. Pain. He has whole body pain, mostly in his abdomen and his leg, and this has been longstanding for 2 years' time. Has been treating with Percocet initially at about 3-4 per day but most recently, as high as 6 per day and in fact, 6 per day is the average. He was seen in the pain clinic and was started on Neurontin. It is unclear how compliant he has been with that regimen. Dr. Hoover has been renewing his Percocet prescriptions. He has had a CAT scan done in the past because of a history of esophageal cancer, which showed no evidence of cancer or no other etiology for his pain.\n2. Esophageal cancer status post resection by Dr. Patton. He has been doing okay from that standpoint, is followed up with Dr. Yan. The last CT scan was in June 2095 that showed some pulmonary nodules and a renal cyst that needed followup. He has not yet had a repeat CT scan that was scheduled for yesterday, and he did not go to the appointment because he wants to do it at the Cancer Center where he feels more relaxed.\n3. Coronary artery disease. He is status post an MI in 2084. He has had several angiograms but no angioplasties by his report. He is followed by Dr. Mckee at the Trimont Health Care Center.\n4. Status post fem-pop bypass of the left side. He says he has been having increasing pain over the last several years on that side, which is why he takes the Percocet.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus with unclear control. His last hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and that was in 10\/94. Status post cholecystectomy, status post appendectomy, esophageal cancer status post resection, and history of idiopathic thrombocytopenia.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Diovan 80 mg p.o. b.i.d, metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d, Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. Percocet 5\/325 six times per day, Dyazide 37.5\/25 one time p.o. q.d, isosorbide 60 mg p.o. q.d, and Lopressor 125 mg p.o. q.d.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Lives with his wife. He is retired. He used to smoke, quit in 2084. Smoked for 20 years 2 packs per day. No alcohol, no drugs.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of cancer, unclear what type. Father died of an MI and had diabetes mellitus.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Comprehensive review of systems was done and reveals that that he has chronic abdominal pain that is unchanged, occasional chest pain, and chest palpitations that has been evaluated by his cardiologist. No fevers or chills. No burning or pain with urination. The rest of the review of systems was negative.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Today, his blood pressure is 122\/80 and his pulse is 80. His height is 6 feet and his weight is 230 pounds. In general, he is in no acute distress. He is well appearing. Sclerae are anicteric. Conjunctivae noninjected. Pupils equal, round, and react to light. His extraocular are movements intact. Oropharynx is without erythema or exudate. Oral mucosa is moist. Neck has no significant lymphadenopathy. JVP is flat. His thyroid is within normal bilaterally. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Good aeration, good air movement, no accessory muscle use. Cardiac exam is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2. He has a systolic murmur, which has been reported previously. His abdominal exam is soft, nontender, nondistended. He has a large central hernia. He has several surgical scars. His extremities, he has no edema, his DP pulses are 1+ bilaterally. His reflexes are trace in the knees, toes are downgoing. His skin exam, he has multiple nevi, some that are rather dark. No specifically suspicious lesion.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 66-year-old gentleman with multiple medical issues.\n1. Diabetes, recheck hemoglobin A1c today. He is going to find out when the last time it was he had an eye exam.\n2. Pain. He has had this pain syndrome for quite some time. He is on short-acting narcotic and I think this is appropriate. I am going to start him on a fentanyl patch 25 mcg p.o. q.d. and decrease his Percocet to 4 per day. Hopefully, we will be able to wean him off his Percocet altogether.\n3. Esophageal cancer. Follow up with Dr. Yan and Dr. Patton.\n4. Pulmonary nodule. I emphasized the need for him to repeat his CT scan. I sent an email to Dr. Yan. He wants to only do them at the Cancer Center and that is where last films were done. I explained how important it was.\n4. Idiopathic thrombocytopenia. We are going to watch this. He had a workup by Dr. Sawyer in the past. He reports no bleeding.\n5. Coronary artery disease. I asked him to get Dr. Landers's records for me, especially his last angiogram. We are going to check his cholesterol today. He will follow up with me in approximately 1 month's time to reevaluate his pain.\n6. His EKG today shows a sinus rhythm at the rate of 60, normal intervals, normal axis, and poor R-wave progression in the precordial leads and as indicated above, possible septal infarct and possible inferior infarct. I do not have a baseline for comparison.4. 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Koontz, MD\n\n\nDictated By: Scott Koontz\n\n\neScription document:9-6525022 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 12\/24\/95\nDT: 12\/25\/95\nDV: 12\/24\/95\n\n* Record date: 2096-12-29\nEDVISIT^28297534^OGRADY, MICHAEL^12\/29\/96^AVILA, KRISTOPHER\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pressure.\nMr. Ogrady is seen by the resident and also seen and examined by\nme. He is a transfer from an outside hospital to be admitted\nbecause of his chest pain.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 67-year-old man who was\nloading some luggage in a car this morning at about 4:30 a.m. At\nthat time, he experienced acute onset of squeezing, chest pain,\nand chest pressure associated with shortness of breath. He\ndescribed his pain as being very intense about 9\/10, described\nheaviness across his chest and shortness of breath. He stated\nthat while he was walking into his place his chest pain got worse\nand since then it was intermittent and stuttering in nature. He\nwas taken to Muncy Valley Hospital where he was seen, treated,\nand transferred here. He is currently pain free. At Oakridge State his troponin was negative. His CPK was\nnegative. His EKG showed a Q-wave in III and aVF and had no\nacute ST elevation or ST depression on his cardiogram which\ncorrelates with our cardiogram here.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His history, however, is significant in\nthat he has a cardiac catheterization that was done in 06\/2093.\nAt that time, he had proximal LAD lesion of 30%, left main was\n30%, and left circumflex was also 30%. He had an RCA lesion\nwhich was 100%, RCA proximal lesion, with good collateral flow.\nHis last echocardiogram was in 03\/2093. At that time, his LV\nfunction was normal and he had an EF of 55% to 60%. His past\nmedical history is significant for diabetes and hypertension as\nwell as high cholesterol, had an myocardial infarction in 2084,\nhistory of metastatic esophageal cancer and history of DVT in his\nleft lower extremity in 2090.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He has had an esophagectomy. He\nunderwent fem-pop bypass surgery in 2088. He has also had a\ncholecystectomy and appendectomy.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He is a 40-pack-year smoker.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Also, has a strong family history of cardiac\ndisease.\nMEDICATIONS: He is now pain free but described his pain this\nmorning as squeezing, pressure like, and heaviness in his chest.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His vital signs here are normal. His\nHEENT exam is benign. His neck is supple with clear lungs\nbilaterally. He has a 3\/6 systolic murmur. He has no rubs or\ngallops. His pulses are normal, well perfused throughout and\nwarm extremities. Abdomen is soft without any masses, good bowel\nsounds. Extremities are normal.\nLABORATORY DATA: EKG as described above again, a Q in III and\naVF, otherwise no acute changes on his cardiogram. His CK is 33\nand his troponin is negative. His creatinine is 1.9 with a BUN\nof 27. All other labs are normal including his blood sugar which\nis 156.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient's cardiologist is Dr.\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\nrule out and maybe even need another cardiac catheterization if\nnecessary.\nDIAGNOSIS: Chest pain and chest pressure with history of an MI\nand history of coronary artery disease.\n\nAVILA, KRISTOPHER M.D.\nD: 12\/29\/96\nT: 12\/29\/96\nDictated By: AVILA, KRISTOPHER\neScription document:3-0867902 BFFocus\n\n\n* Record date: 2098-01-26\n\nReason for Visit\nDate\/Time of Visit:\nMr. Ogrady was transferred to GSH on 1\/26 from Muncy Valley Hospital, where he had presented with shortness of breath and chest pain.

Please see\nhis note for further details. I confirm that I have interviewed\nand examined the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation\non the patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of\ncare, and disposition with the patient.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69-year-old male\nwith a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery\ndisease, previous MI, and esophageal cancer with mets to lung,\nstatus post VATS, and a recent hemothorax and chest tube. He was\ndischarged 2 days ago, now presenting with increasing cough. He\nhad been seen in an outside hospital earlier today and diagnosed\nwith a right lower lobe pneumonia. He was also given 1 g of\nceftriaxone. His complaints prior to presentation had been chest\npain as well as shortness of breath, abdominal discomfort, and\npalpitations. On reviewing his chart, he had had his diltiazem\nand Lopressor discontinued on his last admission. Other systems\nwere reviewed and found to be negative including fevers, chills,\nhemoptysis, or difficulty swallowing.\nMEDICATIONS: Reviewed. Please see the chart. He is currently\non aspirin and took today.\nALLERGIES: IV dye and Neurontin.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is awake, alert, but cachectic\nappearing, and nontoxic. Temperature 98, pulse of 111,\nrespirations 20, blood pressure 104\/61, and oxygen saturations\nare 95%, however, this is on 5 liters. HEENT exam: Mucosal\nmembranes are dry. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy.\nLungs: Crackles at the right lung. Left lung is clear. CVS:\nTachycardic but regular. Abdomen: There is some mild diffuse\ntenderness in the upper quadrants, no rebound or guarding, and no\nMurphy's. He has normoactive bowel sounds. Skin is warm and\ndry. Back is nontender at CVA points. He has got bilateral\nlower extremity edema, but no tenderness in the thighs and\ncalves. Neurologically, he is somewhat somnolent, but oriented\nwithout focal motor or sensory deficits.\nLABORATORY DATA: White count is elevated at 19,300, 90% polys, 2\nbands. Chemistries are normally slightly perhaps more dehydrated\nwith creatinine of 1.3, which is a little above his baseline of\n1.2 when he was discharged. LFTs are all normal including lipase\nand total bilirubin; however, his alkaline phosphatase is mildly\nelevated. First set of cardiac enzymes is negative. EKG shows a\nsinus tachycardia with PVCs and nonspecific inferior ST-T wave\nchanges. Chest x-ray shows bilateral basilar nodules, which have\nbeen there in the past. There is a hazy opacity in the right mid\nhemithorax, which does not look new, however, this could\nrepresent tumor versus pneumonia. However, no significant change\nprior to his discharge.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: Given his dyspnea and his elevated\nwhite count, this case was discussed with Oncology. He was\nadmitted for dyspnea, ruling out pneumonia. He is in stable\ncondition.\n\nOCASIO, GEORGE OJAS MD\nD: 03\/29\/98\nT: 03\/29\/98\nDictated By: OCASIO, GEORGE OJAS\neScription document:8-5838264 BFFocus\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2081-02-05\nLCC EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT XANDERS,RUTH A 564-19-92-7 VISIT DATE: 02\/05\/81 PRESENTING COMPLAINT: Leg fracture.

She has had\nnormal transaminases in the past but a positive hepatitis C\nantibody test. She reports no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting,\nanorexia or weight loss, no diarrhea, constipation, melena or\nbright red blood per rectum. She has had no fevers, chills,\nsweats, arthralgias, myalgias or skin rash, epistaxis, easy\nbruising or bleeding gums and she has no insomnia or episodes of\nconfusion.

Hypertension. 2. Pedal edema. 3. Diabetes.\nHPI: Ruth is a 42 year old woman who presents for follow up of medical issues as well as for new pedal edema over the past 2 weeks. When I saw her a few weeks ago, she was very dehydrated and required a decrease in dose of her Lasix due to symptoms of dehydration as well as a rise in her creatinine and BUN. She responded well to this and then did well for a week or so. Then she saw Dr. Vuong who increased her dose of Lasix back to 20 mg in the evening. Subsequently, she developed pedal edema which, at times, is up to her knees and has been very bothersome for her. Of note, she started Norvasc within the past few months and it was gradually increased to 10 mg a day. She reports her blood sugars have been under excellent control, ranging from 90-120s-140s especially over the past couple of weeks. She has had a couple of lows in the 40s over the past couple of months. She again has not yet followed up with Dr. Vicki Klein as I had recommended for help with her diabetes. She reports her blood pressure in Dr. Vuong's office was normal as well. She denies any orthopnea, PND, increased shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion. No fever or chills. Remainder review of systems negative. She does report sweating with meals that she is unsure how long she has had but has noted it over the past few months.\nMEDICATIONS: As noted in the record and confirmed.\nALLERGIES: Lisinopril causes cough.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her skin is very tanned. Blood pressure 148\/62, on repeat it is 160\/70, pulse of 88, weight of 150, weight is up about 6 pounds for her. HEENT within normal limits. Neck: no JVD. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no crackles or rhonchi. Cardiovascular exam: normal S1, S2, II\/VI systolic murmur at right sternal border. Abdomen is benign. Extremities: she has 1-2+ pitting pedal edema to mid shin.\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: 42 year old woman with: 1. New pedal edema. Reviewing patient's recent lab results, she does have proteinuria but it is actually improved since the last time it was checked and also her creatinine has improved. I believe the pedal edema may be related to the Norvasc. Therefore, I advised her to stop the Norvasc and she will call me tomorrow to let me know how she is doing as it may take a few days to resolve. Will consider increasing her Lasix based on how she responds to discontinuing the Norvasc and her labs. Will check basic metabolic panel and urinalysis as well. 2. Hypertension since discontinuing Norvasc. Will start atenolol in a low dose but advised her not to start this for the next few days. Will start at 12.5 mg a day and increase to 25 mg a day and she will follow up in the next few weeks for a repeat blood pressure check. 3. Diabetes. The patient is strongly encouraged to make an appointment with Dr. Vicki Klein regarding the diabetes to see if there is anything more we can do to change her insulin regimen.\nThe patient to follow up with me by phone tomorrow and otherwise in the next 3 weeks for a blood pressure check and sooner if no resolution of her pedal edema.\nSusan A.

As you know, she is a lovely 47-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking and end-stage renal disease for which she underwent transplantation in 2083. She is now under evaluation for pancreatic transplantation. She has not had symptoms of angina or left ventricular dysfunction and LVEF has been normal. An exercise test in July 2087 achieved 79% of the maximal predicted heart rate, no chest discomfort, but 1-mm of ST depression in the lateral leads. Her other recent issues have included marked anemia, possibly related to her immunosuppressive drugs (negative upper and lower endoscopy) and transient hyperglycemia following a glucocorticoid bolus.\nAt the time of admission, the hematocrit remained in the low 20s and she was transfused in preparation for cardiac catheterization. Appropriate bicarbonate and Mucomyst therapies were administered, and we also took advantage of the precatheterization time to reinforce the importance of smoking cessation.\nCoronary angiography on 08\/11\/2087 demonstrated a co-dominant system with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery with left to right collaterals perfusing that territory. There was also a 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD. After careful consideration of the options, Dr. Valdez placed a Cypher stent at that location successfully. She tolerated the procedure well, was ambulatory the following morning and the creatinine had actually improved to 2.0; the hematocrit remained stable in the mid 20s. She will likely be discharged later today, following a discussion with the renal transplant service regarding augmenting her antihypertensive regime.\nShe understands the importance of uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy, preferably for more than one year.\nIt was a pleasure to participate in Ms. Xanders's care. A copy of the discharge abstract as list of discharge medications will be forwarded to you separately.\nWith best regards.\nSincerely yours,\nStanley V Stanley, MD\n\n\neScription document:3-2627386 KFFocus\n\nDD: 08\/12\/87 DT: 08\/12\/87 DV: 08\/12\/87\n\n* Record date: 2088-02-02\nRenal Transplant Admission Note\nDate this visit: 02\/02\/88\nCause of ESRD: DM T1 Date of this kidney transplant: 9\/83\nCC: SOB\/DOE\nHPI: 48 y\/o F h\/o ESRD 2\/2 DM T1 s\/p renal tx 09\/83.

During the day yesterday, he went on his daily walk with his wife and felt fine. In the evening around 8:30 pm, he experienced dull, 8\/10 pain under both arm pits which resolved within 20 minutes after taking 3 SL TNG 5 mins apart. He denies SOB, N\/V, radiation or diaphoresis associated with this arm pain. He states that he gets similar bilateral underarm pain about twice per week which is usually relieved by a single SL TNG within 10-15 mins. The arm pain is not exertional.\nAfter the arm pain relieved last night, the pt took 3 Aleve tabs which his daughter bought for him for arthritis pain. A couple of hours later, he became nauseated and had a single episode of dark brown emesis. After vomiting, he felt light-headed while walking around the house. He had a bowel movement this AM which he states was darker than usual, almost black looking. He denies BRBPR, abdominal pain, CP, SOB, palpitations, headache, fever or chills.\nIn the setting of significant fatigue and light-headedness, the pt presented to the ED this morning. Admission vitals: 97.2, 120\/78, HR 80's, RR12, sats 97% RA. He was noted to be in A fib. Hct was 22 (down from 38 last week). NG lavage was not performed in the ED. However, he did have another episode of bilateral arm pain which was relieved by SL TNG x 3. HR at the time of arm pain was in the 80's and ECG showed A fib with possible TWI in I,L and V6 but relatively unchanged from admission ECG without pain. He subsequently received lopressor 2.5 IV\/12.5 PO, isordil 10 PO and zantac 50 IV.\n\nPMHx:\n1. CAD\na. S\/p anterior MI 2082 - pt does not recall having chest pain associated with MI\nb.

Per her note, he was admitted with complaints of vomiting up food and constant chest pain for 3-4 days. He reports that he has had some troubles with food for the past few months but can't define precisely what the troubles were. It seems that he intermittently vomited or regurgitated both liquids and solids and had a sensation of something getting stuck in his chest. Over the last 3-4 days everything he ate or drank, including water, would come up. He denies nausea. There is no abdominal pain but he describes a constant pain across his chest at the level of his nipples for the past 3-4 days. His pain is currently controlled. He denies pain on swallowing.

The patient was admitted to Montebello Convalescent with a history of RUQ pain that began on July 3rd. He was found to have choledochal stones and underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy on July 07. Subsequent to this he developed a bout of generalized abdominal pain two days later and he was noted to have a marked and new increase in his amylase and lipase levels (3191 and 2171, respectively), diagnosed as acute post ERCP pancreatitis and transferred to PNC for further management. Dr Gregory Xing explained to him via an interpreter and with images of his CT scan that he has gallstones and pancreatic pseudocysts that have persisted as compared to his last CT in July 2117. The procedure of open cholecystectomy with Roux en Y drainage of pancreatic psudocyst was explained to him and he was consented.\nHe will be an inpatient 3 days prior to surgery for transition from Coumadin to heparin \/ lovenox therapy.

He had preserved LV function and pre-operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non-obstructive CAD. He initially did well, but had a prolonged hospitalization in 7\/17. At that time, he developed acute cholecystitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation. He was admitted to PNC in 1\/18 for elective open cholecystectomy and roux-en-Y cyst-jejunostomy. He underwent the GI surgery on 1\/11\/18. His post-operative course was complicated by recurrent GIB upon re-initiation of anti-coagulation for the mechanical AVR that prolonged his hospital stay.\nUnfortunately, he developed line-associated bactermeia and sepsis 4 weeks into the hospitalization. He developed high fevers on 2\/07\/18 ad he had serial cultures positive for MRSA that had intermediate sensitivity to Vancomycin. He was initially treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin with addition of Rifampin later in the course of treatment. He developed progressive PR prolongation on ECG and a TTE on 2\/10\/18 and TEE on 2\/11\/18 showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess. A follow-up TEE on 2\/17\/18 showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the OR by Dr. Elrod on 2\/17\/18. The intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe RV failure. On POD 0, he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias (VT\/VF) which required ~ 50 defibrillations and open cardiac massage. A TEE done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe TR, and preserved LV function. Emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of RCA vasospasm. An IABP was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm. HE was taken to the OR for closure on 2\/22\/18.\nHis course was subsequently notable for ARF which transiently required CVVH, development of HIT, and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit. ABI testing revealed no evidence of PAD. He was followed by ID and was placed on daptomycin and Bactrim. He was seen by Vascular surgery and was not deemed to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up. With supportive care, he was successfully weaned off IABP and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit. His course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to Bactrim induced RTA. He also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder. He was discharged to a rehab facility on 3\/22\/18 and was discharged from rehab 12 dyas ago.\nSince discharge, he reports doing relatively well. He reports fatigue and DOE after walking up a flight of stairs. He is able to walk up to 15-20 minutes continuously. He denies any chest pain, dyspnea at rest, PND, orthopnea, LE edema, palpitations, syncope, or pre-syncope. He also denies any fevers, chills, or weight loss. He has been seen in follow up by Dr. Infant-Nickel in ID earlier this month. He was noted to be doing relatively well but still had an elevated ESR and CRP. The plan is continue a prolonged oral taper of Bactrim. He has completed a 6 week course of daptomycin.\nPast medical history: 1. MRSA\/VISA prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis. Originally underwent AVR for severe AS on 03\/13\/2117. Developed aortic endocarditis and aortic root abscess as a complication of line sepsis in 2\/18 and underwent composite aortic homograft replacement on 2\/19\/18. Intraoperatively developed severe RV failure. 2. RV failure. Complication of aortic homograft surgery. TEE on 2\/20\/18 showed severe RV hypokinesis and severe TR. 3. HIT. Developed HIT post-operatively after aortic homograft replacement in 2\/18. 4. Coronary artery disease. Preoperative cardiac catheterization on 03\/11\/2117 demonstrated 30% focal narrowing in the left main; proximal 30% lesion in the LAD; 50% lesion in D1; mid 50% lesion in the left circumflex, and normal RCA. 5. Dry gangrene of right 3rd digit of right foot thought to be secondary to an embolic complication of IABP versus HITT. 6. Hypertension. 7.

The patient had a prolonged hospitalization with a complicated post-operative course that was notable for RV failure, ARF, HIT, vascular emboli to the right foot, and mild hyperkalemia. At this point, he appears close to euvolemia by exam and has no evidence of decompensated CHF. HE has evidence of severe TR on exam. From an ID perspective although all recent cultures have been negative, the resistance pattern of his MRSA and persistent elevation of ESR and CRP are concerning, and he will require a prolonged course of anti-biotics as outlined by Dr. Infant-Nickel. His ARF has resolved and his vascular embolic events to the right foot are not an active, acute issue as he only has dry gangrene and no evidence of infection.\nPLAN: 1. PVE endocarditis. He is s\/p composite aortic homograft replacement. He will need a prolonged Bactrim taper per ID. We will obtain CBC, chem panel, LFTs, ESR, CRP per ID today. He is currently on coumadin and will likely need this for a total of ~6-8 weeks post-operatively. We will continue coumadin pending his visit with Dr. Elrod next week. 2. RV failure. Currently well compensated with no evidence of systemic congestion. We will continue his current dose of lasix. Dry weight ~175-178 lbs. I will obtain a repeat TTE to reassess RV and TR severity. We anticipate some recovery of RV function. 3. ARF. Resolved. We will check a follow up chem panel today. 4. Right foot gangrene. Involvement of the right 3rd toe with no wet gangrene or signs of infection. ABI testing in 3\/18 showed no PAD. He will need outpatient follow up with Dr. Werner in vascular surgery. 5. CAD. Non-obstructive disease. Continue ASA, atenolol and lipitor. We will hold on ACE-inhibitor given hyperkalemia issues. 6. Hyperkalemia. Likely secondary to RTA related to Bactrim. Ww will check follow up chem panel today. He will need monitoring of K and we can consider kayexlate therapy if he has persistent elevations for the duration of therapy with Bactrim.\nPatient will return to clinic in 3 months for follow-up.

A radiogram in December\nshowed that he has osteoarthritis in that hip. He has been taking\nMotrin twice a day and finds that he does get some relief with that.\n\nHis left shoulder has been bothering him for awhile but it is actually\nis somewhat better than it has been. It hurts to abduct him more than\n90 degrees or to reach behind his back.\n\nHis left wrist is bothering him some now. It is sore with most types of\nmotion.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, his blood sugar today was 190 early this\nmorning.\n\nRegarding his coronary disease, he has been walking every morning. He\nhas had no chest pain pressure or discomfort.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure is 110\/70, weight is 192 pounds,\npulse is 70 and regular. He is a pleasant black man in no apparent\ndistress. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. Chest\nis clear to auscultation and percussion. Cardiac, S1, S2, regular rate\nand rhythm, no murmurs or gallops. Abdomen is soft. Extremities,\nwithout edema. Right hip, no pain with leg rolling. Left shoulder is\nable to abduct to 90 degrees with no discomfort at all and is able to\nabduct completely with only minimal discomfort. It is nontender to\npalpation. Left wrist, he is a little tender over the medial joint\nline.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\n1. Right hip: I think he has degenerative joint disease and I want him\nto continue on the Motrin as needed.\n\n2. Left shoulder: I may well have bursitis here. He feels this has\nimproved a lot and he would just as soon not do anything different\nfor now but will let me know if it causes more problems.\n\n\n\nIckes, Jr, William\n81071628\n02\/02\/79\nPage 2\n\n3. Left wrist: He probably also has some arthritis in his left wrist.\nHe is tender in the joint line today. It is bothering him a little\nbit but not enough that he would like to do anything about it.\n\n4. Coronary disease: He has been doing well from this prospective. He\nhas no recent chest pain, pressure or discomfort and his LDL has been\nvery well controlled.\n\n5. Diabetes: His last hemoglobin A1c was slightly elevated and we will\ncheck another one today. I will have him follow up with Olga in\nPIMA regarding his diabetic control.\n\n\n\nLarry Frantz, M.D.\n\nLF:jessup;33-437857.doc;DD:02\/25\/79;DT:02\/26\/79;DV:02\/02\/79\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2079-09-14\nPINELLAS EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT\n\nICKES,WILLIAM JR 810-71-62-8 VISIT DATE: 09\/14\/79\nThis patient was seen by myself and Dr. Caldwell on 9\/14\/79.

The patient was in his usual state of compensated health, but approximately one month ago after clearing significance note from his driveway, the patient started to note some anterior chest discomfort. He has a long history of coronary artery disease and this includes angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting in 2065. The pain did not radiate up to his neck or arm, but when the pain persisted even after returning from Blountstown, he went to Roper Hospital North two days ago because of his chest discomfort to see his cardiologist. He was admitted to the hospital, had a cardiac catheterization, which according to the patient did not show any specific lesion. The doctors felt that he did not have a myocardial infarction, but that in fact his abnormality was due to a chest wall\/muscular type syndrome. He was discharged on anti-inflammatory medicine and the patient had noted that when he took the aspirin over the past month, his discomfort was improved. The patient states that he had the chest x-rays at the hospital and in fact also had a CT scan, which did not show any pulmonary embolism. It also did not show any dissecting aneurysm according to the patient.\nLeft renal lesion. As part of his routine workup, the patient did have a CT scan and this identified some left kidney mass possibly on this scan. The patient denies specifically any flank pain or any bleeding and he has no recent weight loss. I spoke to the patient at length about this matter and he will consult with Dr. Jung, the urologist at Roper Hospital North.\nDiabetes mellitus type 2. The patient remains on his usual medicines and according to him, his hemoglobin A1c and blood sugars have remained fairly satisfactory.\nObstructive sleep apnea. The patient does not use his mask and I cautioned him to get back using that, as this may have an effect on his coronary artery disease.\nAbnormal liver function tests, has been present for many years and previously was thought to be due to a fatty liver.\nElevated blood pressure. The patient was noted in the hospital to have elevated blood pressures despite his medicine and he was asked to increase his Norvasc from 5 mg to 10 mg per day.\nGastroesophageal reflux. The patient feels well on Zantac.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Reveals no specific headaches. He denies any trouble with his ears, nose or throat. He has no chronic cough or coughing blood. He denies any nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stool. He has no burning on urination.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant white male in no acute distress. His blood pressure was 130\/90, pulse was 60 and weight 207 pounds. Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat were normal. The neck showed no thyroid nodes or tenderness. The chest did show a healed coronary artery bypass graft scar, but he did have chest wall discomfort to palpation in the costochondral area on the left. The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation. Heart showed a regular sinus rhythm. Abdomen is soft. No liver or spleen was felt. Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema. Neurologically, the patient was alert.\nThe patient was also sent to the office for evaluation because of his kidney function and the use of the scan during the CT scanning and use of the diet.\nThe patient was therefore ordered to have routine laboratory test including complete blood count, CBC, chem profile, lipid profile, urinalysis and I did a hemoglobin A1c because of his history of diabetes.\n1. Chest pain, probably due to chest wall rather than coronary artery disease according to the patient's history. 2. New discovery of left renal mass to consult with Urology, Dr. Jung. 3. Renal function to be rechecked secondary to his CT scanning and history of diabetes with Glucophage, which he has restarted. 4. Status post coronary artery bypass graft. 5. Abnormal LFTs by history. 6. Diabetes mellitus. 7.

He will then stop, pain will disappear. He will continue\nwalking at which time it will occur at about the same distance. There is no rest\npain. The pain had been present for a couple of months although it has been\nincreasing in severity.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Is significant for intracranial bleed secondary to an\nAV malformation. He refused surgery at that time at Campellton-Graceville Hospital and has done\nwell on Dilantin without any seizures. There has been no further bleed or problem\nfrom this malformation. He also has treated hypothyroidism. He is status post\nTURP, cholecystectomy, and appendectomy. He does have a chronic anxiety\ndisorder for which he is on Ativan intermittently. He also has pustular psoriasis.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Dilantin 600 mg per day, which keeps his level at about 7. At\nthese levels he has had no seizures. He is also on Synthroid at 0.075 per day.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a mostly German-speaking man. There is a\nright-sided tremor which has been present since his intracranial bleed. Neck\nsupple. Blood pressure is at 140\/80. Weight 184. Heart rate is at 70. There are\nno carotid bruits. Lungs are clear. Heart is regular without gallop or murmur.\nAbdominal exam - No mass, tenderness, or organomegaly. There are multiple\nscars. There is a bruit over the right femoral artery with a decreased pulsation there\ncompared to the left. There is no pulse palpable below popliteal on the right side.\nThere is no visible ischemic change of the right leg. The left femoral is fuller, and\nthere is a palpable dorsalis pedis on that side.\n\nIMPRESSION: Peripheral vascular disease, probably right iliofemoral. He will\nundergo arteriovascular studies. He will also be placed on aspirin at 81 mg per\nday. In addition he is begun on Lipitor 10 mg per day for hyperlipidemia. He will\nfollow up following that vascular study. This evaluation was also communicated to\nher daughter, Quinn, because of the language barrier.\n\n\nXenia Jaramillo, M.D.\n\nXJ\/camp\/williams\n\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2090-12-13\nPt. of Dr. Jaramillo presents for initial visit as new PCP.

He went in to have an\nAAA repair and suffered a postop MI. He was in CCU for 3-4 weeks at which time\nhe sustained a Pseudomonas pneumonia, small bowel obstruction, and PE. He\nsubsequently had his CABG done at the end of April and was discharged at the end\nof May to Grant Clinic. He did well at Grant Clinic and was discharged\nfrom there on the 10th of June, and he presents to me for follow-up today.\n\nHe states that he feels well. He denies any chest pain or trouble breathing since\ndischarge. He does not remember anything from his hospitalization otherwise. He is\nmentally intact. He reports that he has not had a bowel movement for 3 days and had\nsome pain a couple of days ago. He is passing gas, last done yesterday. No dysuria.\nHis daughter reports that he is eating well, that he is at his baseline mental status,\nthat he has had not had any acute complaints at home.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As per HPI. Also, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder\ndue to a congenital AVM, osteoporosis, peripheral vascular disease.\n\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 q.d, atenolol 25 b.i.d, Zocor 20 q.h.s,\nCarafate 1 gm p.o. b.i.d, Celexa 10 q.d, multivitamins, thiamine 100 q.d, Seroquel\n37.5 q.h.s. and 12.5 q.a.m, Flomax 0.8 q.d, Synthroid 100 q.d, Dilantin 150 p.o. t.i.d,\nColace 100 t.i.d.\n\nVITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 112\/52. Pulse 72. Weight 162.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: General - Elderly male in no acute distress. Appears well in\nconsideration of his recent long hospitalization. Neck - No JVD or bruits noted\nbilaterally. Lungs - Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes or rales. CV -\nRRR. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs. Abdomen - Positive bowel sounds heard in all 4\nquadrants, although mildly decreased. Soft, mildly distended. No masses. No HSM.\nNo fluid wave. Extremities - He has 1+ firm pitting edema to his mid-shin.\n\nLABS: From June 13, 2091, show CBC with white count of 4.4, hemoglobin 11.2,\nhematocrit 32.2. Chem 7 - BUN 26, creatinine 0.7, glucose 203, Dilantin 5.6.\n\nASSESSMENT & PLAN: 76-year-old male, history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,\ncoronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, status post CABG in April as\nwell as AAA repair returns after an extended hospitalization with complications of\npneumonia, SBO, and PE who comes in for follow-up visit. Despite everything,\npatient looks well.\n\n(1) CV. Will continue cardiac medications at this time. Will likely change Zocor\nback to Lipitor but will check his labs first. Patient would benefit from cardiac\nrehab at this time. He is scheduled to see Dr. Nutter at the end of this\nmonth. Will arrange for him to have regular cardiac care after this. He has\nseen Dr. Quesnel for his postop CABG issues.\n\n(2) PVD. Patient status post AAA repair. He has seen Dr. Uddin and is doing\nwell.\n\n(3) Neuro. Patient on Dilantin 150 t.i.d. as per Dr. Acuna. It would be okay to\ndecrease him to 100 t.i.d. as he was before. Will check his levels today but\nlikely decrease to 100 t.i.d. Will refer back to Dr. Acuna for follow-up.\n\n(4) Endocrine. Will check TSH. Likely will continue current Levoxyl dose.\n\n(5) Osteoporosis. Okay to restart Fosamax.\n\n(6) GI. Patient with constipation. He can start Citrucel or Metamucil twice a day.\nCan also use Dulcolax daily until he has a bowel movement and then decrease\nto every other day as needed. Can also adjust fiber therapy as needed.\nInstructed patient and daughter that if patient is passing gas, it is okay.\nHowever, if he stops, they should call immediately.\n\n(7) Psych. They should continue Celexa and Seroquel for now. Will review charts\nfrom Grant Clinic to see why medications were started and will likely\ntaper him off them.\n\nIn general, need to review records from Grant Clinic in order to see what\nhappened there. Will consider that in my recommendations for his further care.\nReturn to clinic in 2 weeks.\n\n\nDebra A.

The patient first presented to Waverly on 10\/22 with complains of weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite and bilateral shoulder pain for a few weeks. He denied dyspnea, chest pain or pressure, productive cough, sore throat or runny nose. He was noted to have a fever of 101.2 at Waverly but denied other subjective fevers. His daughter had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia but he has no other sick contacts. At Waverly labs were drawn, a chest xray was done and he was given motrin and Tylenol and sent home. He returned for follow up the next day feeling no better. His labs reviewed a leukocytosis and acute kidney injury and his chest xray showed a RLL pneumonia. He was sent to the CGH for further evaluation.\n\nOn presentation to the ED at 1pm on 10\/23, his VS were 98.2, 87, 122\/60, 97% on 2LNC. He got 500cc of NS, Levaquin 750mg PO x 2, Ceftriaxone 1gm IV x 2 doses, his home doses of dilantin, finasteride and plavix and sent to the floor.\n\nUpon arrival to the floor he was in no distress.

She is regularly being followed by Dr. Jarvis, Nephrologist at Salvation Army Hospital, was seen there about two months ago and will return there in June. She is also treated for her chronic anemia with darbopoetin. The patient recently has noticed that her blood sugars have decreased progressively, and she has had several episodes of near hypoglycemia. Blood sugars are often 60 or less. The patient also complains of pain in her right middle finger and right shoulder pain.\n\nPhysical examination reveals an elderly female in no acute distress. Blood pressure is 142\/60, weight is 176 pounds, and pulse is 96. Glucose done in the exam room today was 110. Chest is clear bilaterally. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2, negative S3, S4, and no murmur. Abdomen is soft, nontender, and positive bowel sounds. Lower extremities: No edema and nontender. Right hand tenderness in the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the overlying tendon and also tenderness diffusely in the right shoulder pain with grossly normal range of motion.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n1. Diabetes mellitus. The patient's blood sugars have been dropping. The patient has decreased her glipizide already from 20 mg daily to 10 mg daily. I will further decrease it to 5 mg daily. Check hemoglobin A1c today as well as ALT, AST, and creatinine.\n2. Chronic renal failure. The patient's creatinine clearance is about 15-17, and the patient is approaching end-stage renal failure. She is being followed by the Renal Department at Salvation Army Hospital, and dialysis is being considered for the midterm management of the patient.\n3. Tendonitis, right middle finger. After the patient's informed consent was obtained, the area was prepared in the usual sterile fashion, and 1% lidocaine along with 0.2 cc of Depo-Medrol was injected in the area of the flexor POLLICIS longus tendon sheath. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n4. Anemia. This is obviously due to the patient's chronic renal disease. She has been receiving darbepoetin injections, initially weekly, then every other week, and now every three weeks. We will check CBC today.\n5. Right shoulder pain. The patient cannot take nonsteroidals due to her renal problem, so I have given her a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine, of which she may take one or one-half tablet as needed to control the pain.\n6. Regular healthcare maintenance. The patient will follow up with me in about two months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfant Brewer, MD\n\n\nDictated By: Infant Brewer\n\n\neScription document:2-5091452 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 05\/25\/79\nDT: 05\/26\/79\nDV: 05\/25\/79\n\n* Record date: 2079-11-09\n\nCocke County Baptist Hospital\n0295 Keats Street GLENN, OLIVIA\nWhitewater, NC 13662 10776605\n(545) 266-9272 11\/09\/79\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old female who returns to the clinic for a complete physical examination.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.

At her\nrehabilitation facility was noted to be hypoxic and thus was sent\nhere. The patient's recent past medical history is remarkable\nfor a fall with cervical fractures, rib fractures, and subsequent\nhemothorax for which she was admitted to the Educare-Pullman ICU over the\nend of December through the beginning of January. The patient's\nchest tube was withdrawn approximately 10 days ago and the\npatient has been doing well at rehab since. However, today was\nnoted to have desaturations to 80% on room air. She had\nshortness of breath as well. Her oxygen saturations improved\nmarginally on oxygenation and have been responsive to\nnonrebreather treatment in the transport here. The patient was\ntreated with nebulizers and Lasix without significant improvement\nand is noted to be quite tachypneic.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for hypertension, CHF,\ndiabetes, asthma, chronic renal insufficiency, osteoporosis,\nanemia, and cervical fracture.\nSOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Limited\nby the severity of the patient's presentation.\nMEDICATIONS: Insulin, Zocor, PhosLo, calcium carbonate,\nProtonix, Niferex, Norvasc, Fosamax, Epogen, Lasix, lisinopril,\nColace, and Xalatan.\nALLERGIES: Morphine and aspirin.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is awake and alert, in some\ndegree of respiratory distress, however, able to interact and\nanswer questions in 1-2 word sentences. Vital signs are as\ndocumented with an elevated blood pressure of 176\/96, pulse 76,\nand oxygen saturation is 98% on nonrebreather. HEENT exam is\natraumatic, normal to inspection. The patient has a large tongue\nand her uvula is not visible at all. Neck is immobilized in a\nC-collar and is obese. Respiratory exam reveals decreased breath\nsounds diffusely with tachypnea and respiratory muscle accessory\nuse. Cardiovascular exam: Regular rate and rhythm without\nmurmur. Pulses are palpable in all four extremities. Abdomen is\nsoft and nontender, obese, but without any organomegaly or\nmasses, or guarding, or rebound. Skin is intact, warm, and dry\nwithout any lesions or rash. Musculoskeletal exam reveals\ntenderness over the right ribs where the patient has known rib\nfractures. Neurologically, she is oriented with difficulty\nspeaking due to respiratory distress but no focal neurologic\ndeficit.\nLABORATORY STUDIES: BNP is elevated in the 500-600 range. White\nblood count is slightly elevated at 10, hematocrit 26.3, which is\nat the patient's baseline, and creatinine of 2.2. LFTs within\nnormal limit. INR 1.2. D-dimer significantly elevated. EKG\ndemonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes.\nIMAGING STUDIES: Chest x-ray shows bilateral effusions, which\nare present previously but possibly slightly increased.\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was initially given\nLasix and nitro with improvement in her blood pressure and was\nalso started on CPAP. She seemed to be improving clinically for\nsome period of time but then began to decline in her mental\nstatus. At that time an ABG was sent demonstrating hypoxia.\nPrior to those results, the decision was made that the patient\nlikely needed intubation. We had hope to hold off to do a\nthoracentesis; however, the patient's clinical course declines\nsuch that it was not possible for her to sit up for the\nprocedure. On CPAP, the patient's oxygen saturations were stable\nthroughout in the 90s, but she developed increasing respiratory\ndistress. Intubation was complicated by her inability to flex\nher neck, her large tongue, and her body habitus; was successful\nin two attempts with one episode of bag mask ventilation in\nbetween those attempts. For full details of the procedure,\nplease see the attached procedure note. Thoracic Surgery was\nconsulted. They arrived as the patient was being intubated. At\nthis time their recommendation is for a CT scan of the chest to\ndetermine whether this is more likely a hemothorax or a pleural\neffusion and whether it is loculated. This study will be\nperformed and then patient will be admitted to her ready bed in\nthe ICU. A bedside ultrasound was also performed by myself and\nthe resident demonstrating no obvious pericardial effusion.\n* Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral pleural effusions.\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory distress.\nTERTIARY DIAGNOSIS: Question recurrent hemothorax versus pleural\neffusion.\nFOURTH DIAGNOSIS: Question CHF.\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the ICU.\nCRITICAL CARE TIME: 75 minutes.\n\nWOODRUFF, FERNE MD\nD: 01\/14\/80\nT: 01\/14\/80\nDictated By: WOODRUFF, FERNE\neScription document:9-3389642 BFFocus\n\n\n* Record date: 2080-04-15\nEDVISIT^10776605^GLENN, OLIVIA^04\/15\/80^URIBE, HAROLD\nSeen by me along with Dr. Oglesby on 04\/15\/2080.

Ruled in for an MI and subsequent cardiac catheterization showed three vessel disease and she underwent three vessel CABG. Postoperative course relatively smooth although she had been postoperative pneumothorax and had a chest tube which was only needed briefly. Patient did quite well and was discharged to her daughter's home approximately 1 week after her surgery. Prior to her surgeries there was a brief episode where patient was confused and was having trouble speaking, a neuro consultation was called, a CVA was ruled out and it appeared patient may have had changes secondary to medications. Has not had any further recurrence of these symptoms.\n\nSince her discharge patient has been doing quite well, no complaints of any chest pain, gets a little bit short of breath after exerting herself for a while but this is secondary to lack of conditioning and comes on gradually and results quickly as she rests. Has more energy, had previously asked for a walk of a core she felt weak and now does not feel the need for this. Also had had some lower extremity edema and this has now resolved. Reports compliance with her new medical regimen with no untoward effects. She was discharged to home without aspirin. Patient followed by Dr. Nesbitt and has a follow-up appointment with him end of January, also has follow-up appointment with cardiothoracic surgery.\n\n2. Gastric ulcer. Patient had a gastric ulcer last July, biopsy without any evidence of malignancy and no evidence of H. pylori. During recent hospitalization had a follow-up EGD which showed no evidence of continued disease. Patient does report that for the past two nights she has woken up during the night with some stomach discomfort. This seemed to have been relieved this morning by Prilosec. Not using any NSAIDs.\n\nSocial History: Living with her daughter for the moment in Culpeper Colorado but hoping to move back to her own apartment in Adrian.\n\nPhysical Exam\n\nPatient is in no apparent distress.\nWeight: 114 pounds\nBlood Pressure: 114\/56\nNeck: supple without thyroidomegaly, no lymphadenopathy. Without JVD.\nLungs: Clear.\nCor. S1, S2 without gallops, rubs or murmurs.\nAbdomen: non-tender, without organomegaly.\nExtremities: without edema.\n\nAssessment and Plan\n\n1. CAD. Doing quite well, continue current regimen. Patient to call if any new complaints or problems, recurrence of chest pain. Will speak with Dr. Nesbitt regarding whether she should restart aspirin q.day, contact patient if recommendation is to restart.\n\n2. Gastric ulcer. Recent repeat EGD with no evidence of recurrent disease. Now with some recurrence of epigastric pain. For the moment she will increase omeprazole to 20 mg b.i.d. and take if this does for several weeks and then go back to previous dose. If continues to have epigastric pain or needs higher dose of omeprazole will need further investigation.\n\nI will see her for follow-up in two months.\n\n\nOsvaldo Lilly, M.D.\n\nPlease excuse any transcription errors, typed with voice recognition technology.\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2099-01-06\n\nChief Complaint\nannual, menopausal vaginal atrophy\nLast Pap:\n2096\nLast Mammogram:\n9\/98 WNL\nLMP:\n2096\nLast Bone Density:\n6\/98- t-1.80\nContraception: Abstinence\nunable to have intercourse\n\nPast History\n--- Menstrual History ---\nmenopausal, no PMB\nAbnormal Paps:\ns\/p CKC 2060s\nSTD's: None\n\nProblems\nDiabetes mellitus\nCAD s\/p quadruple bypass 2096\ns\/p E.coli sepsis 2096\nARDS\/ Seizures requiring extended MICU stay, colostomy\nSVC thromobosis 2096\ns\/p sternal oseomyelitis w\/ graft 2096\ns\/p cold-knife cone in 2060s\ns\/p partial thyroidectomy\nMedication list: : MVI, CA+D, fossamax, prograf, cellcept, prednisone, nexxium, ASA, lipitor, Toprol XL, coumadin, insulin\n\nPhysical Exam\nGeneral Appearance: NL Habitus\nNeck: Normal\nThyroid: Normal\nResp.

She currently wears accommodative orthotics typical for somebody with her deformity. She has noted that perhaps over the last two weeks or so that a callus has formed under the plantar lateral aspect of the left foot. She denies any drainage, erythema, or increased swelling or warmth in the foot. Her orthotics were made in September and seem to be working quite well for her. She admits however that over the last month and half or so that she has been wearing boots that her current orthotics do not fit in. Apparently, she has had to resort to her old orthotics, which did not take her Charcot deformity into account.\n\nHer past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. Her medications include Prograf, prednisone, Prilosec, an aspirin a day, Imdur, calcium supplement, a multi vitamin, Lantus insulin, and Humalog with meals. She takes Imuran, Coumadin, and Toprol XL, as well as Lipitor. Her past surgical history is significant for colostomy in 2094, fistula repair in 2095, coronary artery bypass surgery times four in 2096, a kidney transplant in 2097, and a fistula ligation in 2098. She quit smoking ten years ago and has no known allergies to medications.\n\nPhysical examination is centered mainly around her left foot. She has diminished sensation to ten-point examination with a Semmes-Weinstein 5.05 monofilament. She has multiple toe amputations, all of which have healed nicely. She does have a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse. The skin is of normal turgor. She has no active plantar ulcers on\nPage two\nRe: Nancy Xayarath\nDate: February 17, 2100\n\n\n\neither foot. At the apex of her rocker bottom deformity on the left side there is a callus that I d brided in the office underlying which is a grade 0 ulcer.\n\nNo new x-rays were obtained today.\n\nDiagnosis: Grade 0 ulcer, diabetic left foot.\n\nPlan: She has not reached the dermis on her left foot, however, should she continue to weight-bear without mechanical off-loading it is only a matter of time before this develops into a grade I ulcer. It is unclear to me whether the culprit is an orthotic that needs to be remolded or the fact that she has been wearing boots with an inappropriate orthotic. I am going to have her see Samantha Albright, our orthotist to have the insoles remolded with Plastizote. I have asked Ms. Xayarath to bring the shoes that she typically wears as well as the boots she wears. We will follow this development closely as Ms. Xayarath is perfectly aware of the potential downsides of forming an ulcer. She knows to contact me if she has any questions or concerns in the meantime. Thank you kindly for this referral.\n\nBest personal regards,\n\n\n\nFredrich L. van Butler, M.D.\n\nFLC\/conley\/MF\n\n\n* Record date: 2100-07-07\n\nHumalog 0-2\/4-8\/6-10 111-64-17\nLantus 10 U hs Xayarath, Nancy\nPrograf 2 mg bid\nImuran 100 mg qhs\nPrednisone 2.5 mg qd starting last week\nOmeprazole 20 mg qd\nLipitor 40 mg qd\nToprol XL 25 mg qPM\nImdur 30 mg qd\nCoumadin 4 mg tablets (for SVC stent): 4 mg 2\/7; 6 mg 5\/7\nASA 325 mg qd\nCaltrate with D 1200-1500 mg per day in divided doses\nFosamax 70 mg qw\nCentrum QD\nFolate 1 mg qd not taking\nCelexa 20 mg qd\n\nJuly 07, 2100\n\nInterim History:\nComes to review her medical problems.\n\nShe had been losing weight and feeling fatigued.

Per his wife, in April he described left hand weakness. He stopped smoking at the time and stated that his deficit resolved. He was in his usual state of health until this evening. He last noted feeling normal after the Coyotes game, which ended at about 7:30PM. He subsequently took a nap, per his routine, and awoke at 11:00PM to ready himself for his night shift as an RN. He took a shower and noted weakness in his right arm during the shower. After, while trying to put his clothes on, he developed progressive weakness such that his arm became plegic and he was no longer able to stand. EMS was phoned and the pt arrived at the GBH ED around 11:40PM. NIH stroke scale = 12.

MRI with diffusion to assess distribution of stroke and whether diffusion\/perfusion mismatch is present.\n3. allow blood pressure to autoregulate, with approximate SBP goal 140-180. When scanning done, pt should be extubated and exam followed, correlated with blood pressure.\n4. consider heparin if territory of infarct is not so large as to render hemorrhage into infarction too great a risk.\n\n\n\nVladimir Aguilar, M.D.\nNeurology Resident\nPager #68458\n\n\n\n\n\n* Record date: 2070-03-24\nNeurology Clinic Follow-up\n\nID: 50 RHM s\/p large R MCA stroke 10\/20\/69 with subsequent hemicraniectomy complicated by abdominal and head wound infections\n\nHPI: Patient presented initially 10\/20\/69 after a fall due to the acute onset of left-sided weakness. Head CT showed hypodensity in the R MCA territory, and CTA revealed R ICA occlusion. The patient was admitted to the neuroICU. Follow-up head CT the morning after admission revealed hypodensity involving the entire R MCA territory. Because of malignant swelling, he went on to require hemicraniectomy which was performed by the Simmons Neurosurgery service. He recovered and was discharged to rehab on 10\/28 with left hemiplegia and dense left-sided neglect. Aspirin was prescribed for stroke prophylaxis but was subsequently stopped at rehab for unclear reasons.\n\nHis stroke work-up revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hr Holter monitor. A hypercoagulability panel was negative. Homocysteine was normal. Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.\n\nThe patient was re-admitted on 12\/02 with an abdominal bone flap infection. The flap was removed and long-term antibiotics prescribed. He did well and then was re-admitted 01\/01 with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting. His hemicraniectomy site revealed protruding brain which required revision in the OR. Long-term antibiotics were again prescribed for possible infection of the site. The patient did well, but routine follow-up MRI of the cranium on 3\/8 shows a large, rim-enhancing, DWI bright fluid collection adjacent to the hemicraniectomy site. This may represent abscess. Dr. Bennett, Simmons Neurosurgery attending, intends to admit Mr. Rico 3\/27 for fluid sampling and culture. Additional operative intervention may be indicated if this fluid collection is indeed infected. Patient denies fever or chills. He has had headaches frequently during the past couple of weeks. This was a major problem early in his course but then resolved.\n\nMr. Rico has now been out of rehab for 2 months, and he is doing quite well. He is able to walk with the assistance of a four-post cane. His appetite is good, and he sleeps well on trazodone. He has a very close family who is intimately involved in his medical care. His spirits have been good considering the ordeal he has recently been through. While in rehab, his wife apparently deserted him after accruing a great deal of credit card debt from gambling. He cries when he tells me about this. A close female friend has moved in to his home and cares for him 24 hours a day. He is able to assist with ADLs but cannot function independently. His left leg has some strength, but his arm remains completely paralyzed. There are occasional twitches in the thumb that are not voluntary.\n\nHe has had a great deal of left shoulder pain related to subluxation at that joint. An orthopedist suggested that the family consider shoulder fusion at some point in the future when the patient has recovered maximal function in the arm. He also has occasional hip pain on the same side that is less bothersome. Neurontin has been helpful for the shoulder pain, though the family believes that higher doses lead to a depressed mood. They are trying to decrease the amount of Dilaudid he uses.\n\nPMHx:\n-stroke as above\n-HTN\n-hyperlipidemia\n-DM\n\nMeds:\n-Zestril 5\n-trazodone 150\n-Avandia 4\n-Glucophage 1000 bid\n-insulin\n-Neurontin 400 bid\n-Zantac\n-Lopressor 50 bid\n-Dilaudid 2 tid\n-Lidoderm patch to L shoulder\n-Pravachol 20\n-Paxil 20\n-folate, B vitamins\n\nAll: Allegra -> unknown reaction\n\nSoHx: Lives with daughter and female friend.

For neuropathic pain in the shoulder, will try Elavil 25 qhs. Patient will stop trazodone. If Elavil is helpful, may increase to 50 qhs after one week of therapy. Once Elavil up to 50 qhs, would slowly taper Neurontin as per patient and family preference. At next appointment, if persistent left arm paralysis (which is likely), will encourage surgical fusion of the shoulder.\n5.

This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke. He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap. His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor. A hypercoagulability panel was negative. Homocysteine was normal. Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia. His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy. Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070. He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele. A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett. Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting. This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use. The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated.\n\nI last saw Nathan on April 2nd of this year at which point he was doing quite well. He complained of some hot flashes of unclear etiology. His depression seemed to be under better control on Celexa.\n\nToday he reports that he continues to have trouble with neuropathic pain on the left side of his body. Fortunately he has managed to wean himself off of methadone and this has not caused the pain to get any worse. He is using a substantial dose of Neurontin, which he thinks is helpful. He complains that these pains involve his face, arm, and leg on the left side and he wonders whether there might be some relationship between the pain and the shunt, which was placed on the left side of his head. He also complains of occasional leg spasms at night, which are not particularly bothersome. His most significant complaint at this time relates to the hot flashes that he mentioned at our last visit. These often occur several times daily, although they may not occur for several days at a time. He explains that most of the episodes occur when he is in bed at night. He first develops a feeling of nausea followed by a cold sensation on one side of his body or the other. This has been followed by a feeling of heat from the top of his head down to his toes. There may be a feeling of urinary urgency. He then experiences a sensation as if he is floating on the bed, and generally this is followed by nausea. The entire episode lasts only seconds but the nausea may persist for as long as an hour. He also notes on some mornings he does not feel like getting out of bed. He continues to experience depressed mood, and he longs to return to a normal state of functioning.\n\nHe has returned to volunteering as a Big Brother. He is unable to work. His divorce is now complete and he is really glad about this. He is living with a friend named Tejeda who takes excellent care of him.\n\nHis left arm remains paralyzed. He has minimal proximal strength in his leg. He has a dense visual field deficit on the left side.\n\nHe has one new complaint which is a feeling of numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th fingers on the right side.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS include Celexa 20 mg daily, Neurontin 600 mg q.i.d, Phenergan p.r.n, Avandia, Glucophage, Lopressor, Zestril, Pravachol, insulin, and aspirin 325 mg daily.\n\nOn exam Nathan is well-appearing. His hair has now grown back. On mental status exam he is able to relate a cogent history. He has a number of questions about stroke rehabilitation possibilities including a hyperbaric oxygen program that he learned about in Connecticut. Eye contact is good. On cranial nerve exam pupils are round and reactive and extraocular movements are intact. There is a left visual field deficit. The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop. The tongue protrudes in the midline. The left arm is completely plegic. The left leg has greater than anti-gravity proximal strength. There is left-sided sensory extinction. Reflexes are brisk on the left and normal on the right. Nathan is able to ambulate with a cane and a left ankle foot orthosis.\n\nWe spent much of today's visit discussing various issues that concern Nathan. Regarding the possibility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for stroke rehabilitation. I explained that there is no convincing evidence in favor of this approach. There are some risks to hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as lung injury and the programs are extremely costly. Therefore I advised Nathan not to pursue that option.\n\nRegarding his frequent hot flashes, which are very bothersome, the etiology of these episodes is quite unclear. Dr. Mays mentioned the possibility that these episodes represent some sort of diencephalic paroxysmal discharges. I think it is possible that these are a side effect of Celexa; I believe that they first occurred shortly after starting Celexa. We decided to stop the Celexa for a 2-week period to see if there is any improvement in the episodes. If there is, I would consider changing to an antidepressant that works by a different mechanism. If there is no change in the episodes we can go ahead and add Celexa back.\n\nI neglected to mention above that there is sensory loss to temperature and pinprick in the right hand involving the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar aspect of the hand on the palmar surface. There is no motor dysfunction in the hand. There is no Tinel's sign over the ulnar nerve at the elbow. The ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove is not hypermobile. The symptoms and physical exam are consistent with ulnar entrapment neuropathy, which I suspect is the result of arm flexion during sleep. I suggested that Nathan buy an elbow pad with a Velcro strap that will help facilitate keeping the arm straight during sleep. We will keep an eye on this over time.\n\nNo other changes are indicated at the moment. I intend to see Nathan in followup in about 6 months.\n\n\n\nLeroy Kelly, M.D.\n\ncc:\n\n\n\nTD: 11\/26\/2071 12:12:15\nTR: quijada\nJob ID: 568143\n\n\n\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2066-07-26\n\n\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: PER DR VARNEY\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: s\/p CABG 2 weeks ago; doing well without Sx CP\/SOB; was depressed last week but now feeling much better that she walking outside home and back on Wellbutrin (inadvertantly stopped) Here to have chest skin sutures removed\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Entered By:frye On:03\/13\/2066\nEndocrine disorders: type II, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Const: no fever, chills, sweats, weight change, or malaise\n\n\nCV: no chest pain, dyspnea on exertion or palpitations\nResp: no SOB, no cough, no wheezing\nGI: no abdominal pain, no diarrhea, no constipation\n\nMusc: no back, shoulder, limb pain, no myalgias\nSkin: no rashes or pruritis\n\nPsych: not depressed or anxious\n\n.\n\n\n\nEXAMINATION: well appearing, in good spirits\n\nlungs CTA; no JVD, incision C\/D without erythema\nRRR nl S1S2 no murmur\/rub\nno edema\n\n8 sutures removed without complication from along chest incision line\n\n\nIMPRESSION: Con't current meds\nsmok cessation reinforced\nD\/C dig secondary to adverse effects\n\nf\/u cardiac surg: Dr. Austin\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:\nACETAMINOPHEN W\/CODEINE 30-300MG One PO q4 - PAIN : 07\/25\/2066 - 04\/17\/2067 ACT : emmons\nScript: Amt: 12 Refill: 0 Date: 07\/25\/2066 : emmons\n\nLIPITOR 10MG PO qd : 05\/10\/2066 - 04\/15\/2068 ACT : rosenberg Script: Amt: QS Refill: 1 Date: 11\/20\/2067 : rosenberg\nGlucophage 500mg one PO bid : 04\/08\/2065 - 11\/12\/2067 ACT : stephens\nScript: Amt: 60 Refill: 3 Date: 04\/24\/2067 : stephens\n\nASPIRIN 325MG PO qd : 03\/02\/2065 - 03\/30\/2074 ACT : rosenberg\nmultivitamin 1 po qd : 03\/02\/2065 - 03\/30\/2074 ACT : rosenberg\nLOPRESSOR 50MG qd : 03\/02\/2065 - 11\/12\/2067 ACT : rosenberg Script: Amt: 30 Refill: 3 Date: 10\/26\/2066 : rosenberg\n\n\nIMMUNIZATIONS:\nInfl 11\/25\/2065\nPneu 11\/25\/2065\n\n\nTHIS IS A COPY PRODUCED FOR THE LMR.

Vester Light, M.D. WV:AV:8176 DD:9-5-67 DT:9-6-67 DV:9-5-67 * Not reviewed by Attending Physician *\n\n* Record date: 2069-07-18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 18, 2069\n\n\n\nVester Light, M.D.\nInternal Medicine\nBarton Memorial Hospital\n\nRE: Jennifer Vance\nMR #542-66-00-3\n\nDear Vester:\n\nMrs. Vance presents to the office today for general cardiac\nevaluation. As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it\nbriefly for our records. Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with\na history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes and\nsignificant coronary artery disease. In 2061, after a four to five\nday history of retrosternal chest discomfort, she was admitted to\nthe Barton Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography\nrevealed a 95% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis.\nShe underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with\ninadequate results. She therefore was taken electively for\ncoronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left\ninternal mammary artery to her LAD. She subsequently continued to\nhave chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization\nin May of 2063 at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60%\nstenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50%\nstenosis in the mid right coronary artery. The catheterization\nreport does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary\nartery graft. Since then, she has continued to have episodes of\nintermittent abdominal discomfort. She recently has undergone an\nextensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her\nabdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered. Trials\nof H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective.\nIn November of 2068, she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test\nexercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131, peak\nblood pressure of 188\/82 stopping because of fatigue. She had no\nischemic changes on electrocardiogram. Over the past two weeks\nhowever, she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome\n(which she often describes as feeling like indigestion) now\nincludes radiation to her left shoulder. The pain is not\nexacerbated by position, time of day or any particular activity.\nThe pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest.\nOf note, her lipid profile from October 2068 indicates a\ncholesterol of 229, triglyceride of 68, HDL 51, LDL of 164. Vance, Jennifer\nMR #542-66-00-3 -2- July 18, 2069\n\nPast medical history is notable for variegata porphyria, insulin\ndependent diabetes, right hand carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren's\ncontracture and tendinitis and hypertension.\n\nMedications at Present: Enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d,\nNPH insulin 25 units sub q qAM, CZI 10 units sub q qAM.\n\nAllergies: None.\n\nCigarettes - none. Ethanol - social.\n\nFamily history is notable for her father dying from carcinoma,\nmother dying of colon cancer, question coronary disease, one\nbrother having a myocardial infarction at age 25, another brother\ndying from melanoma age 36. The rest of her siblings and children\nhave not heart disease.\n\nPhysical exam reveals a delightful woman in no acute distress.\nBlood pressure right arm sitting 110\/64, heart rate 85 and regular,\nrespirations 12 and unlabored, weight 104 pounds. The neck is\nsupple. JVP flat. Carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft right\ngreater than left bruits. Chest is clear.

Nonetheless, I am concerned that\nher clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia.\nI therefore have scheduled her for an exercise MIBI stress test and\nI will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasive\nstudies. In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin\ndependent diabetes, I strongly recommend beginning aggressive\nantilipemic pharmacologic therapy. Unless her variegata porphyria\nprecludes the use of atorvastatin, I would begin this at 10 mg po\nq.d. I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than 90. In\naddition, I have started her on atenolol at 25 mg po q.d. and\nI would consider beginning an ACE inhibitor again if her\nporphyria does not\nVance, Jennifer\nMR #542-66-00-3 -3- July 18, 2069\n\npreclude this.

Koontz, M.D. Internal Medicine Associates Barton Memorial Hospital 70 Batchelder Street Minerva, TN 41694\nDear Wanda:\nMr. Vance returns for followup. Since last seen, she apparently was recently seen in the walk-in clinic in your office complaining of profound fatigue and depression. She wonders if she was having a flare of her porphyria. Apparently, her examination at that time was relatively benign, and no specific new findings were noted. After talking with Dr. Vogt at that office visit, she felt modestly improved, and over the past few weeks feels that her energy level has returned to its baseline. Lab studies obtained at that time revealed creatinine 0.9, glucose elevated at 236, hematocrit of 43, with a white count 10. As no specific pathology was noted, she was sent home without any change in her medical regimen.\nCurrently, she continues on Lantus insulin 20 units subcutaneous. q.p.m, Celexa 40 mg p.o. q.d, enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d, Flonase 1-2 puffs p.o. q.d, isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d, Neurontin 600 mg p.o. t.i.d, nitroglycerin p.r.n. which she has not had to take, lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d, furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d, and p.r.n. Motrin.\nPhysical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress. Blood pressure right arm sitting 105\/78, heart rate 70 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight is pending. The neck is supple. JVP is flat. Carotids are 2+ with very soft bilateral referred murmurs. Chest is clear. Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1\/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, and a 1-2\/6 holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla. No significant diastolic murmur or rub. The abdomen is benign. Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema. Peripheral pulses are diminished but detectable.\nElectrocardiogram is pending.\nImpression: Ms. Vance remains relatively stable from a cardiovascular perspective. However, as you know, her last echocardiogram did show evidence of at least moderate mitral regurgitation with significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function. She has made it quite clear that under no circumstances would she consider repeat cardiac surgery to treat her valvular heart disease. Nonetheless, I think it would be helpful for her to undergo repeat echocardiogram to help gauge the current status of her left ventricle and degree of regurgitation, which may allow for additional modifications to her therapeutic regimen. Beyond this, her condition is actually relatively stable from a cardiovascular standpoint. I have not further altered her medical regimen.\nThank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.\nSincerely yours,\n\n\nTimothy Quarterman, M.D.\nDictated By: Timothy Quarterman\neScription document:6-0437424 GFFocus\nCC: John Koontz MD 489 MONICA STREET MINERVA, TN 41694\nDD: 05\/10\/73 DT: 05\/11\/73 DV: 05\/10\/73\n\n*","completion":"no"},{"prompt":"\nRecord date: 2161-08-09\nPatient Name: LE, WILLIAM; MRN: 0540099 Dictated on: 08\/09\/2161 by WILSON RUCKER, M.D.\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient presents for evaluation of chronic neck and left arm pain. HPI: This is a 71-year-old right-handed gentleman with past medical history significant for insulin-dependent diabetes, coronary artery disease, status post bypass surgery, hypertension, and bladder cancer, who presents with worsening neck and left arm pain, which is now interfering with his daily life. The patient has had a chronic arthritic pain throughout his body, which he has been complaining of for approximately 10 years involving his neck, shoulder, arms, knees, and back. More recently in the past months to couple of years, his neck, left arm, and shoulder pain have been his predominant pain symptoms. It has been a gradual onset. He has had similar problems in the past. He reports that his pain is intermittent and occurs daily. He states the pain is burning, cramping, pins and needle, sharp, numb, shooting pain, dull achy, electric- like, throbbing, and pressure-like. The pain involves numbness to his hands and fingers on his left arm. His pain ranges from 10\/10 at worst to 0\/10 at best. It is worse in almost all active positions including lying down, standing, sitting, walking, and driving. Medications do not seem to help. Relaxation and rest decreases the pain. It is also worsened by lifting or bending his neck. He tried physical therapy approximately 10 days ago at Manamana with minimal to no relief. The patient has had injections to his cervical spine in the past, he has had shoulder injections, which helped in the past. He had MRI performed of his cervical spine on March 21, 2161, which documented moderate- to-severe degenerative changes throughout his cervical spine with significant right neuroforaminal narrowing at multiple levels. There is narrowing of the left neural foramen at C5-6. PAST MEDICATIONS: The patient is not clear what pain medicines he has taken in the past. Current medications include Nexium, Colace, atenolol, aspirin, Neurontin 200 mg two times a day, insulin, Pravachol, glucosamine chondroitin, vitamin E, Lasix, and potassium chloride. He has allergies to penicillin, Vioxx, and Lipitor. Past medical history is significant for high blood pressure, heart disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure, and bladder cancer. SURGICAL HISTORY: He denies any spine surgery. He has had two prior arthroscopic knee surgeries. He had twice left shoulder surgery; he is not clear what this was. He has had a TURP. PSYCHOSOCIAL HISTORY: He has high school eduction. He is not currently engaged in regular exercise program. His pain does limit his daily activities, especially bending over and also affects his recreational activities including regular yard work and lifting. He also has lifting restrictions from orthopedic physician as well as yard work restrictions from his cardiac physician. He is a retired wholesale specialist. He worked for over 30 years in sales business. He is not currently working. He is married and lives in Dickinson, Maryland. He denies any history of alcoholism, detox program or current tobacco use. He denies any history of psychologic evaluation or treatments including and no history of abuse. He has family history heart disease and diabetes. Review of systems is negative for any unexplained weight loss, fevers, chills, recent infections, bleeding, positive bowel or bladder incontinence, numbness in the genital area. He does report some numbness and tingling in his arms as well as legs as reported above and some generalized weakness of his muscles, particularly with his left upper extremity muscles throughout. He denies any problems with sleep. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In general, he is a well-appearing gentleman appearing his stated age, slight obese, well nourished, well groomed. Psychiatric: Normal attention and concentration, normal mood and affect. Eyes: Conjunctivae anicteric, no ptosis. Skin: No rashes or lesions. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: No intercostal retractions or accessory muscle use. Musculoskeletal: Spine inspection, no significant kyphoscoliosis. Cervical range of motion is limited throughout. Flexion 20 degrees, extension 10 degrees, rotation is 20 degrees, right and left. The patient is unable to side bend significantly. Reflexes are 2+, bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis. Manual muscle testing is 5\/5, bilateral upper extremities with the exception of wrist extension, shoulder abduction, and shoulder flexion and extension, and internal, external rotation. Muscle tone is normal with the exception of asymmetry in the left hand interossei. Sensory testing is impaired to pinprick, throughout bilateral upper extremities to the elbows. Intact grossly to light touch per the patient's report. Gait is steady with a cane. The patient has signs of limited range of motion in the left shoulder, status post multiple surgeries and limited range of motion in all directions. He has some palpation tenderness of the cervical spine, in C5-6 and C4-5 paravertebral areas on the left. Medical decision making involved review of the patient's radiology reports and radiology films. IMPRESSION: The patient has a significant degenerative disease of his cervical spine. In addition, he has multiple levels of neural foraminal narrowing and herniation in the cervical spine. In addition to this, he has symptoms consistent with diabetic peripheral neuropathy with also prior traumatic injury to his shoulder with possible brachial plexopathy. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Given the multiple etiologies possible for his symptoms in his left arm, which are his predominant symptoms: Brachial plexopathy versus peripheral neuropathy versus cervical radiculopathy, we have referred the patient for an EMG to delineate the cause of his symptoms. 2. He will return to clinic after his EMG and from that point, we will decide the course of action for pain management. At this time, he will continue on the Neurontin 200 mg two times a day. We will review his medications on next visit. We provided the patient also with education in regards to his problems and the treatment options.

He still has significant difficulty walking, and he is falling frequently at home. He has not sustained any significant injuries. He has numbness and paresthesias of his feet, but there has been no interval change in his symptoms since his last visit in November 2162.\n\nMedications: Neurontin 300mg TID, Lasix 40mg daily, aspirin, Atenolol 50mg daily, Zetia 10mg, Pravastatin 20mg, Nexium and multi vitamins.\n\nExamination: reveals that strength testing in the legs is normal. He has absent deep tendon reflexes of the ankles, trace to 1+ at the knees. Romberg's test is positive, and the patient has difficulty standing without assistance. Despite the degree of sensory ataxia, he is still able to feel position sense at the metatarsophalangeal joints in his feet. Vibration and pinprick sensation are diminished.\n\nData Review: The patient does have a persistent low concentration of monoclonal protein in the slow gamma region. This is unchanged compared to the previous study done in February 2162. This most likely is a MGUS.\n\nImpression and Recommendation: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, complicated by polyneuropathy. The monoclonal protein is an incidental finding and is probably not accounting for his peripheral neuropathy. Given that the monoclonal protein has not changed in concentration or character I do not believe that there is a need for additional testing at this stage. He will continue with Neurontin to manage his neuropathic symptoms. I have urged him to try and maintain good diabetic control.

His chest pain syndromes have resolved. He has a long-standing trifasicular block and had what sounds like syncope a few months ago. This was associated with bradycardia and has resolved with changing him to low dose coreg.\nCV risk factor modification remains our primary focus.\nPlan.\n1. CAD-increase asa to 325 and take at night with niaspan in hopes of lessening side effects. He needs an ARB, so will try again to get him to take diovan at 80 a day (I gave samples and a Rx).\n2. LV dysfunction--we will check a GBPS for EF.\n3. DM-followed by Dr. Orton. Continue to aim for an A1c of 7.0\n4. Carotid disease--this seems to be limited to the external carotid, so I don't think any intervention will be necessary. Continue to Rx risk factors.\n5. Lipids-look great today. Continue as is, but given his past intolerance of and noncompliance with meds, I suspect he will give up the Niaspan soon! We will try to give asa with it to help with the side effects.\n6. HTN--home BPs have been higher too on coreg. I am trying to get him on an ARB again. Diovan at 80 a day.

As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago and had stenting at that time and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076. He has done well since that time without any exertional angina, dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema. He has been followed here by Dr. Opal Garner and has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm. He underwent surgery for hip replacement of his left hip last summer and has recovered from that. He did get on to about 220 pounds before the surgery, but has gained 20 pounds back and is now at about 240 pounds. He says that most of this is because of inactivity. He likes to work in his yard in Barnstable and plans to increase his activity and try and drop off some of that weight this summer.\n\nPast medical history:\nSignificant for diabetes, large anteroseptal myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, diverticulosis, tubular adenoma of the colon, and diverticulitis.\n\nCurrent Medications:\nImdur 30 mg qd\nLasix 10 mg qd\nLipitor 20 mg qd\nlisinopril 40 mg qd\nPlavix 75 mg qd\naspirin 325 mg qd\nPrilosec 20 mg qd\nToprol XL 25 mg qd\nnitroglycerin PRN\n\nFamily history:\nUnchanged from previous visits.\n\nSocial history:\nHe is retired. He lives in Barnstable. He likes to work in his yard. He quit smoking several years ago.\n\nReview of systems:\nUnchanged from previous visits.\n\nPhysical examination:\n-Pulse: 66 and regular\n-BP: 130\/70\n-resp. rate: 12 and unlabored\n-General: He is a well-developed, well-nourished white male in no acute distress. Alert and cooperative. Mildly overweight\n-Heent: No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag. Mucous membranes are moist. Trachea is midline\n-Neck: Thyroid is nonpalpable. Carotids are 2+ without bruits, have a normal upstroke. JVP is less than 7 cm of water\n-Chest: Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes\n-Cardiac: Reveals a normal S1 and S2, with a grade 1\/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border\n-Abdomen: Normal bowel sounds. No organomegaly. No pulsatile masses\n-Extremities: Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric. He has trace pedal edema bilaterally\n\nProcedures:\nEchocardiogram test STATUS POST His last echo. which showed an ejection fraction of 52% with some asymmetric septal hypertrophy with upper septal prominence. There was trace MR and trace TR and the evidence of his apical aneurysm.\nStress test STATUS POST at that time as well as 07\/10\/2080. He exercised for 4 minutes, got to 44% of his predicted maximum heart rate. There was no evidence of ischemia. There was evidence of a previous anteroapical, anteroseptal infarct.\n\nEKG:\nshows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, right bundle branch block, and a possible old IMI and old ASMI.\n\nSelected recent labs:\nThe patient's last blood work was 08\/17\/2080 and at that time his BUN was 9, creatinine 0.8, potassium was 3.8, blood glucose 145, cholesterol was 96, triglycerides 70, HDL 42, and LDL 40.\n\nAssessment and plan:\nIn summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a big anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago. He has had stenting of his coronaries in 2076. He is without any evidence of ischemia at this time. He has a fairly good LV function. There is an LV aneurysm, but Coumadin has been deferred and he has been treated with aspirin and Plavix. He is on a good medical regimen. Blood pressure seems to be well controlled. He does not have any evidence of severe decompensated congestive heart failure. He does have some trace pedal edema. His weight has gone up significantly since the operation for his hip and I have encouraged him to start walking program and try and drop off that weight this summer. I would like to do CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, and a CBC with lipids today. My plan would be keep him on his current regimen and see him back here in another six months to see how he is doing with his weight. Cholesterol has been in very good shape and I do not expect that to be a problem.\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\nImdur 30 mg qd\nLasix 10 mg qd\nLipitor 20 mg qd\nlisinopril 40 mg qd\nPlavix 75 mg qd\naspirin 325 mg qd\nPrilosec 20 mg qd\nToprol XL 25 mg qd\nnitroglycerin PRN\n\nAs always, it is a pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentleman.\n\nBest personal regards.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\nBrent Cameron MD, PhD\n\nSigned electronically by Brent Cameron MD, PhD on Apr 19, 2081\n\n* Record date: 2081-12-03\n\nCARDIOLOGY\n\nALGIERS MEDICAL CENTER\n\n\nNicholas M Osuna M.D.\nInternal Medicine\nAMC Interoffice Mail\n,\n\nDear Dr. Osuna:\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology at AMC. As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago, stenting at that time, and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076. He has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm and when I saw him in October, was having some discomfort which may have been myocardial ischemia and angina. His blood pressure was elevated, so we added Diovan to control the blood pressure. He has had some dimunition in the symptoms and the frequency of these symptoms got arrangement for. Exercise test was also put in place and the exercise results are now available as well as the echocardiography that had been scheduled at that time. He still has occasional ankle swelling, but is able to walk without discomfort. He has gained some weight over the summer and is having difficulties staying away from salty foods, particularly he likes pastrami. He is no longer using a CPAP.\n\nCurrent Medications:\naspirin 325 mg qd\nDiovan 80 mg qd\nImdur 30 mg qd\nLasix 10 mg qd\nLipitor 20 mg qd\nlisinopril 40 mg qd\nnitroglycerin\n\nFamily history:\nUnchanged from previous visits.\n\nSocial history:\nUnchanged from previous visits.\n\nReview of systems:\nUnchanged from previous visits.\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-Pulse: 80 and regular\n-BP: 135\/90\n-resp. rate: 12 and unlabored\n-General: He is a mildly overweight white male in no acute distress. Alert and cooperative. Oriented x 3\n-Heent: No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag. Mucous membranes are moist. Trachea is midline\n-Neck: Thyroid is nonpalpable.

No organomegaly. No pulsatile masses\n-Extremities: Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric. He has trace pedal edema bilaterally\n\nProcedures:\n\nEchocardiogram STATUS POST shows an ejection fraction of 67%. concentric LVH, mildly dilated left ventricle with regional wall motion abnormalities, trace mitral regurgitation, and trace tricuspid regurgitation.\nStress test STATUS POST nuclear stress test; which showed limited exercise capacity exercising for 5 minutes and 28 seconds. Imaging showed an ejection fraction of 31%. Perfusion images showed mild-to-distal anteroapical and septal scars associated with mild distal anterior ischemia. The apex appeared more aneurysmal than the previous stress test and the LV was more dilated with a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from 38 to 31.\n\nEKG:\nshows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and a right bundle branch block with an old IMI.\n\nAssessment and plan:\nIn summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a large anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago, had stenting his LAD in 2076, and now has a recurrence of what sounds like possible angina and a positive stress test has a decrease in LV function, increase in LV aneurysmal dilatation, and ischemia in the anterior distribution. There is a discrepancy between the ejection fraction on the echo and I suspect that has to do with differences in technique. I have talked with the patient about cardiac catheterization and I would like to get him in for that as soon as possible so we can assess the degree of coronary disease. Hopefully it is amenable to percutaneous angioplasty, but I am somewhat concerned about the left ventricular aneurysm. We will arrange for cardiac catheterization either next week or the following week and I will plan to see him back here in the office approximately a month which will be after his catheterization and hopeful angioplasty.\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\naspirin 325 mg qd\nDiovan 80 mg qd\nImdur 30 mg qd\nLasix 10 mg qd\nLipitor 20 mg qd\nlisinopril 40 mg qd\nnitroglycerin\n\nAs always, it is a pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentleman.\n\nBest personal regards.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\nBrent Cameron MD, PhD\n\nSigned electronically by Brent Cameron MD, PhD on Dec 08, 2081\n\n\n*","completion":"no"}]
